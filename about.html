            <h3>Why Software?</h3>
            <p>
                Despite how I feel about it now, it may surprise you to know I used 
                to be vehemently opposed to entering the software industry. As a kid 
                I struggled a lot with the idea of nerdiness, and often tried to appear more 
                normal. This obviously failed, since it wasn't who I was.
