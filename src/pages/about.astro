          My History
        </h2>
        <p>
          Motivated by a curiosity for human behavior, I earned my degree in
          Psychology from
          <a href="https://www.colostate.edu/" target="_blank" rel="external">Colorado State University</a>.
          This foundation has led me on a 7+ year journey of merging psychological
          principles with operational strategy, digital content creation, and
          user experience design.
        </p>
        <p>
          My diverse skillset includes business strategy, process optimization,
          business growth, UX/UI design, and web development.

        My Vision
      </h2>
      <p>
        As technology continues to advance and its influence grows, I want to
        bring back the power of real human connection. My dream is to create
        experiences that bring people together, build communities, and make
        digital spaces feel personal and relatable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way we use these new technologies and tools will shape our future.
        How we spend our daily lives and interact with the digital world is paramount.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm committed to designing these touchpoints with creativity, empathy,
        and an understanding of human psychology - ensuring every interaction
        leaves a lasting, positive impact.
