For thousands of years, we’ve always written for each other. For humans. The invention of language, and the many improvements since that led to the widespread availability of text through magical computer boxes has always been towards that end.

Until the last few years. Until the rise of Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

For what it’s worth, I like writing for humans. For people. I put a lot of thought into how to phrase things, how to explain ideas the best way, and how to tell compelling stories to get you interested in the topic.

To me, writing is at its best when we use it to get our ideas across, from fantastical worlds of fiction with vivid setting and intriguing characters, to pouring out the wisdom we’ve accrued into solid form for others to enjoy.

SEO, on the other hand, is pretty much the opposite of that. It’s maybe the three least exciting letters since “IRS” or “CPA” (sorry to my accounting friends, but I’m trying to make a point).

Whether it’s a blog, a creative venture, or marketing your business, SEO is an integral part of your success. We’ve reached a point where it’s arguably more important to write such that search engines know what the heck you mean than that humans do.

Let me say that again. *It’s more important for Google to like your headings and understand their keywords than to write compelling work.*

What do I mean? Is that a hot take? Let’s unpack.

## Search Engine Optimization and You

If you’re here, and it isn’t because you like me on Threads (a small blessing some have given me), then you probably found this through a search engine. Really, based on the [overwhelming statistics](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share), you probably found me through Google.

What that means is my success in being discovered, in having your attention focused on my ramblings at this moment, depends on whether Google smiles upon me. This can be a great thing, but it has also led to the internet becoming plain and, honestly, kind of weird. Not in the classic “wow the internet is weird,” meme kind of way, but in a much more benign and much more frustrating way.

Try this: Google something you’re interested in learning about. Let’s say, “easy curry recipes to make at home.” What you’ll see in the results is that all of the headings on all of the listings will contain some mash of the words from your search, usually in a reasonable order.

Sometimes they're not. Sometimes we even get into situations where local restaurants name themselves “Thai Food Near Me” in an attempt to game the system. We’ll get to that later, both in its consequences and its hilarity.

Most likely, though, you’ll see “easy chicken curry” or “easy chicken curry recipe” or “quick curry recipe,” and, ignoring the focus on chicken that I didn’t include in my search, this is largely useful. It helps me find the info I want quickly, and all of the links I click from there will, admittedly, help me make some (chicken) curry.

This is the beauty, and the power, of keywords. Google takes my search, stuffs it into a magical algorithm box, and spits out results it thinks I’ll like based on its [space wizardry and web crawling](https://jasongarvin.com/blog/seo-versus-humans#google-documentation).

When looking for a recipe, this is almost always a good thing. I get quick and easy results accurate to what I need, and I can move on to making tasty curry. All of which is pretty cool.

This breaks down a bit though when we start talking about marketing, especially content marketing, and about the ever-homogenizing march to front-page discoverability.

## Writing for Machines

There are a lot of criteria for how Google (and other search engines) rank content and what tends to rise to the top of the heap. The science of how that works is, essentially, what SEO means.

Put simply, to earn favor with the magical algorithm box, I should play nice, include plenty of keywords I want to rank for (but not so many it’s literal nonsense), and ideally, prove that lots of people care I exist based on consistent traffic and external links from other sites to my own.

Where that gets weird is when people try to game the system. For a while, someone could stuff a ton of relevant words in a page and it would seem more related and thus appear higher in the rankings.

Google and other search engines are way smarter than that, however, and have since improved their algorithms to detect this blatant abuse and punish it.

Now, don’t get me wrong. Those sites still exist. There’s all sorts of weirdness out there: invisible text, text colored as the background so humans don’t see it, entire paragraphs of the same words repeated over and over, and more. But they’re not terribly interesting, or problematic. They get filtered out and functionally disappear.

The bad ones are the ones that seem almost human, uncannily so, but that are just a little bit wrong. They have strangely-phrased sentences that appeal to search queries more than actual human grammar, and seem to repeat themselves. They can be longer than necessary in order to seem more substantial, and are often really, really hollow.

What irks me is how these sites aren’t designed to be user-friendly. To extend the curry metaphor, a recipe needn’t be a 10-minute read. Hell, sometimes it’s better as a quick video and a paragraph of explanation, or a list of ingredients and simple steps.

Yet, that’s not what happens. Often, you might stumble across a page promising an easy curry recipe, yet instead tangents into all sorts of semi-related topics, repeats the ingredients list over and over in different ways, and seems to tell each step 2-3 times.

It’s not clear for humans, but it’s not meant to be. It’s writing for the machine.

## Writing for Humans

So we know now that to get onto that coveted first page of Google, I need keywords, ideally similar to popular search queries, and a heft of repetition.

If I succeed, people will click on my thing. My silly little strategy worked, and they’re here. Great. Now they can read the content! The reason I bothered with SEO!

Except my god, how boring is my writing if I do that. My last blog was a small example of this homogenization. ["6 Things To Know When Buying a Business."](https://jasongarvin.com/blog/buying-a-business.html) It’s effective and honest, sure, but there is exactly no personality to it.

That’s not to say it’s a bad post&mdash;in fact, I highly recommend it (watch out, I’m biased). But it is to say it’s not how I’d like to write that title, or the headings, because I’d rather make it more fun for you without balancing for discoverability.

My problem is I like personality. This is how I actually am. This is my actual writing style. I enjoy choppy sentences, vague sassiness, and using all manner of ridiculous word choice to keep your attention.

I like writing like this because it’s fun, because (hopefully) it’s more interesting to you, and because it’s a real reflection of what you would experience when stumbling across my path in real life. I like writing like this because it’s authentic.

SEO doesn’t feel authentic. It feels like I’m playing a game to convince the algorithm to serve me up to more people, only I’d feel ashamed to have those very same people arrive on my site only to find the same bland writing style, the same titles, the same headings as every other freaking site on the internet.

This is not a post on making chicken curry. It doesn’t need to be objective and flat.

Honestly, neither does a recipe about making chicken curry. I think it’d be fun to come across a recipe that is, itself, a little bit spicy. In fact, convince me why it should be chicken! Make me care about your way of creating the dish.

But I digress. The recipe serves its purpose. It’s there so I can get in, learn what I need, and get out. And in being as discoverable as possible, it succeeds in reaching me with its personal take on the “right” way to make curry.

I’m not here to provide you with an objective fact as quickly and efficiently as possible, though. Maybe I’d do that on Threads, or X, or by making a reel since they’re designed to be lightning fast. But this is long-form writing. The experience, and the approach, matters.

Long-form writing is, to me, about connection. It’s about storytelling, authenticity, and leisure. I don’t want to make you read a boring 15-minute lecture. I don’t even want to write it.

Instead, I would love to take you on a 15-minute journey that leaves you with a feeling of thoughtfulness, and a realization that “wow, I can’t believe it’s been 15 minutes.”

I want you to have fun here. And SEO isn’t fun.

## Why We Write

Chances are, you know some of this already. If you’ve written on the internet before, or run a small business, you’ve invariably run up against SEO.

You might be using a plugin to abstract it away, like Yoast for WordPress or the myriad other excellent tools that will genuinely help you improve your ranking on Google. Some of them even do it without (totally) destroying your writing, and that’s excellent.

And look, I get it. Ranking on Google helps you succeed. It drives traffic. Traffic improves sales. Your livelihood is at stake.

For me, though? I want to write with the intention to hand-craft every word and every sentence. It may be imperfect, but it’s real, and it’s the closest we’ll get to human connection across screens and potentially thousands of miles.

I’m happy you’re here. I want to write for you, and so that we may understand one another better through meaningful, authentic language. After all, isn’t that why language exists in the first place?

## Resources

Google has plenty of documentation on [what’s behind the space wizardry](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/how-search-works) and how to play nice. I’d take it with a grain of salt since they wouldn’t possibly reveal the secret sauce, but it is an interesting look into how results are ranked, if you’re curious.
