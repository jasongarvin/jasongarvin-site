        Time is funny–often it manifests as a series of cycles, each with
        different steps we must pass through, over and over, until we can start
        the next.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s easy to be caught up in those cycles, reactionary, defensive, or
        even avoidant. I fell into many of those traps this year, because I
        forgot something crucial: patience.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all my time alive, and in everything I’ve achieved, the only tried
        and true path to success in my own life has been patience. All the best
        things I have in life today came from slow, gradual change,
        understanding, time, and attention. Some things can’t, or shouldn’t, be
        rushed.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I want to talk about the cycles I’ve been in this year. The good.
        The bad. The ones I’ve rushed, and the ones where I’ve taken my time to
        create something incredible.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-1" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">Wins and Losses</h2>

      <p>
        Last year, I set a few lofty and public goals. In hindsight, they were
        all pretty vague and hard to quantify, so I’m going to try to set better
        goals for this year, but let’s review them real quick.
      </p>
      <p>This year, I wanted to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Improve Total Escape Games’ branding and operations, streamline how we
          run the store, and grow the business
        </li>
        <li>Join the local Chamber of Commerce</li>
        <li>Get more involved with other local businesses</li>
        <li>
          Do more art, complete drawing challenges, and explore new mediums
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        There were other, smaller, and more personal goals, but those are the
        ones I committed to publicly. In my personal life, I also wanted to
        reconnect with friends and acquaintances, make more time for good
        conversation, and try new things.
      </p>

      <h3 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">The Good</h3>

      <p>
        The good news is that the store did great. This year, Total Escape
        Games:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fully transitioned business ownership, including all wholesale
          accounts, new bank accounts, renegotiated contracts, new
          subscriptions, and a full audit of every tool we’re using and paying
          for
        </li>
        <li>
          Launched a brand new website made with WordPress that has a
          fully-integrated eCommerce solution that ties to our in-person point
          of sale
        </li>
        <li>
          Made a critical new hire to improve team efficiency and allow us to
          staff more deeply at busy times, plus let go of an underperforming
          member of the team
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Also, in the process of doing so much work for the store, I ended up
        getting to work on quite a few creative projects, including the redesign
        of our website, graphics for the store, logo changes, and other
        collateral.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doing so much work with the store helped me realize a few things about
        business ownership in general that felt like big unlocks for me, and
        built my confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        First,
        <i>holy hell there’s more to it than I thought</i>. Also less than I
        thought. It’s a weird mix. On the one hand, I was surprised how few
        things were going on behind the scenes that I wasn’t already at least
        helping with, so it was reassuring to know we really can run the
        business truly and completely on our own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I doubled down on supporting the team and clearing the way for all
        our specialized employees to get work done, and they absolutely crushed
        it. I’m so proud of everyone we have with us today, which is a great
        feeling. We hit our event goals, our sales goals, and our growth goals
        for 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding the personal goals, I didn’t spend as much time on creative
        drawing as I’d hoped, though I did complete a 30-day drawing challenge
        in addition to Inktober.
      </p>

      <h3 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">The Bad</h3>

      <p>
        I didn’t join the local Chamber of Commerce. I have done a ton of
        networking this year in spite of that, and I do feel closer to many
        business owners in the industry who I respect, but in specific terms of
        joining the local Chamber, I failed this goal in 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I was wholly unprepared for the amount of paperwork, phone calls,
        meetings, regulations, and compliance matters I’d have to complete in
        the first few months of our business ownership transition.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was shocked when it took us four months to fully move every account
        over to our names, remove the previous owners, change bank accounts, and
        rewire all the hundreds of places using the old financial information.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was hard, and exhausting, and I hate signing things now. Joking. Sort
        of.
      </p>
      <p>
        The store also wasn’t able to migrate to our new bin-sorting approach to
        our nearly 500,000 Magic singles, and I realized there isn’t good enough
        software to support us overhauling our system yet, which took some of
        the wind out of my sails.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, the hard work and disappointment was also rewarding. I feel
        so able to handle things now, like no matter what crazy compliance issue
        or new legislature takes place, I at least have a framework in my mind
        now of how to navigate it, and have access to the necessary resources
        when I do need help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plus, I did&mdash;with the store’s help&mdash;contribute a lot to local
        nonprofits and schools, which helped connect us better with the
        community around us, not to mention gave us the opportunity to support
        some incredible local initiatives, giveaways, and charity causes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because I’ve been so busy with the store, I didn’t get to spend nearly
        as much time on personal or professional software projects as I’d
        intended. I managed to start learning JavaScript, and Vue.js, but that’s
        about it. I did less web design overall than I’d hoped.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did get pretty proficient in WordPress though in building the site for
        the store, made enough time to redesign this website and rehost to
        Cloudflare Pages, and snuck in some coding projects when I could.
      </p>

    <section id="subsection-2" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">Letting Go of the Past</h2>

      <p>
        Look, there’s only the present. We can make goals for the future, and
        learn from the past, yet we’re perfectly wedged between, and all we can
        control is now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius further entrenched this belief in
        me this year, even though it was something I already held in my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The past has been tough. I mean, everything good and bad that’s ever
        happened to any of us exists in the past, essentially.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking into the past for lessons and to grow is a great approach to
        life, however, we must be careful not to linger too long and be seized
        by it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s easy to regret, to worry, and to be hurt by the past we’ve lived,
        not to mention the events that have dragged us down and given us pause.
        Yet, we are not defined by those events, and instead must allow
        ourselves to move past them and become more.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, this year I’m letting go of the past. It’s difficult, and it takes a
        great deal of patience both with myself and with the world, but it’s
        working.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s not easy to let go of, or accept, 30 years of experiences and built
        up expectations, and this is one of those things I realized this year is
        going to take time, and that there’s no way to shortcut it. But every
        time I’ve made the effort this year to work slowly and deliberately
        through things, I’ve been happy with the outcome on the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s also coincidentally why this post is a couple of days late going
        out&mdash;let’s just say it’s been a crazy start to the new year, and
        2024 had surprises up its sleeve even down to the last days.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-3" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">Embracing the Future</h2>

      <p>
        There’s no real way to predict the future accurately, at least as far as
        I can tell, so instead of trying I think we’re all better off living in
        a way where we’re happy with our current choices while also leaving room
        for our future to surprise us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, if you can see the future, send me a message. I have so many
        questions, and I’m sure we could talk for hours. But unless that’s a
        superpower out there in the world somewhere, I’m going to have to settle
        for an idle curiosity of the future, instead.
      </p>
      <p>Because, really, what is more exciting than infinite possibilities?</p>
      <p>
        That’s how I’ve come to understand the future. I make goals and set
        ambitions for what I’d like to achieve, both personally and
        professionally, yet what I’ve come away with this year is to go with the
        flow and to not be so rigid in my own expectations that I miss valid
        opportunities because they appear unfamiliar to me at first glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The future can be anything. That’s neither good or bad, it simply is.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, rather than worrying about the future,
        <a
          href="/blog/posts/overcoming-decision-fatigue-strategies-for-business-owners"
          >I’m learning to prune my decision-making
        </a>
        such that I can make quick decisions when necessary without exhausting all
        options and chasing all outcomes, and I can also pull back to give myself
        ample time to consider the consequences when the time is right.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve learned a new kind of flexibility when considering an unknown
        horizon that offers strength both in business leadership and in
        navigating my own life.
      </p>
      <p>This year, I’ve learned to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Let go of control</li>
        <li>Avoid spending time on things I dislike</li>
        <li>Dwell in the current moment and find the flow</li>
        <li>Address problems immediately so they don’t fester and grow</li>
        <li>
          Embrace money as a resource to have meaningful and fun experiences,
          especially with good company
        </li>
        <li>
          Accept hardship, difficult emotions, and struggles, and work through
          them with intention
        </li>
        <li>
          Take surgery seriously, take more time off, and not push it. Seriously
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-4" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">Endings and Beginnings</h2>

      <p>The year started with me losing something dear to me.</p>
      <p>
        Yet, it also started with me finally owning the business that I’d been
        helping to lead for many years, and an opportunity to continue growing
        both as a person and as a budding entrepreneur.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was bittersweet, to be sure, and the trend continued throughout the
        year.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I had to get clear on what I want from life. This brought some
        amazing new people into my life and, at the same time, led to the exit
        of several people from my life when I realized my values weren’t
        aligning with theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took my first paid consulting work this year, and grew my store
        substantially. I also stepped down from my position as Product Designer
        at Fill & Fire to focus more on my other ventures and on my own personal
        development.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these were difficult, but especially leaving Fill & Fire was
        hard. The people on that team are like family to me&mdash;they’re people
        I care deeply for, working towards a goal I strongly believe in, and I
        was happy to have contributed over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's hard to leave when things are good. But I needed to re-consolidate
        myself around the factors most core to my life and my goals, and it's
        important to be true to these tough decisions when they come up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even that was a huge learning experience for me. The end of something
        beautiful which I truly valued has offered a new beginning in my career,
        one where I work towards bringing my expertise to other businesses to
        serve on their Board of Directors, or even to consult on business
        strategy.
      </p>
      <p>Last year, I didn’t know those were things I even wanted to do.</p>
      <p>
        So, it’s been a long, hard, and emotional year, full of parting and
        saying goodbye. Yet, it’s also been a hopeful year, full of encouraging
        new opportunities, incredible new connections, and an interesting and
        unknown future that fills me with curiosity.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-5" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">Trusting the Process</h2>

      <p>
        Life is an incomplete path. We’re never a complete piece of art, or a
        perfect person. Instead, it’s a journey in which we take incremental
        steps towards becoming the best version of ourselves possible. It takes
        time, patience, and a great deal of understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be easy to get lost in the many twists and turns of life, but I
        think it’s important to maintain your vision of who you are and your
        values, so that you can properly navigate.
      </p>
      <p>In a sense, that’s what I mean by “trusting the process.”</p>
      <p>
        Set an intention–a business goal, a personal achievement, anything. It
        has to be something big, the culmination of your life’s work, for it to
        truly serve as your North Star. Figure out the kind of person you have
        to be in order to achieve that goal, and who you’d like to be once you
        reach it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, you start moving. Day by day, you work in a consistent rhythm with
        your goals, trying each time to become a little bit more like who you
        want to be. That’s the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        What you’ll find in the end, I hope, is that even if you miss the
        original goal you set, you’ll have still become a great version of
        yourself, and will certainly have surprised yourself by finding delight
        and opportunity along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of life is a process, and the only way through is to trust that each
        thing that happens is a necessary step towards where we’re meant to be.
        What we can control, we do, and in so doing become the version of
        ourselves that’s capable of achieving our goals so that, when we get
        that opportunity, we can seize it.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s what I’d like to believe, anyway. I’ll let you know if I get
        there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Until then, Happy New Year, and I wish you all the success in the world
        in 2025!
