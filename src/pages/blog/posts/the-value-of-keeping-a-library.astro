        There are 7 books within arm’s reach of me right now, and 58 more within
        six feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s not all of my books, either, or even close. Just the ones that
        drift around the periphery of my desk. I haven’t read all of them. Maybe
        I’ve read half. That might be generous, or it might be low. It gets hard
        to keep track.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know people with hundreds more books than me, and I’m fascinated by
        it. Some of the best conversations I’ve ever had came from shared
        knowledge of books, or through exploring ideas one of us learned from
        reading.
      </p>
      <p>Books are incredible, and I’m going to convince you why.</p>

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">It's Important to Unwind</h2>

      <p>
        Reading will, over time, help you turn off the overthinking parts of
        your brain and relearn how to focus on long-form content.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you start your reading journey, it’s likely you’ll have a hard time
        staying focused. Single pages can feel exhausting if you’re not used to
        it. You might have to reread paragraphs to remember what they say.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s partially because we’re trained now to enjoy short-form,
        immediate, gratifying content. It releases dopamine. It keeps us on
        social media.
      </p>
      <p>
        I understand, it’s hard. There were large stretches of my own life where
        I didn’t read, couldn’t focus, or made excuses to avoid the books I
        owned. It’s human, and it happens. I’m not saying you should become an
        absolute reading savant. Just, give it a try. Buy a few books with
        interesting topics. Give them a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if you thumb through them only on occasion, having them around your
        house is a great start.
      </p>
      <p>
        Books help us short-circuit the nonsense we’re being fed, and remember
        how to stay focused on the bigger picture. This is even true when we
        don’t constantly read them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine the internet goes out. I don’t have to, personally, because
        that’s a battle I’ve been having with my ISP for weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do you do? If you own books, you can relax on the couch and read a
        few pages. It might not keep you engaged right away, especially not if
        you’re used to tv and social media and all sorts of high-dopamine,
        addictive activities. But it’s so, so much better than pacing your house
        wishing you had something to do, and you might be surprised how fun it
        is once you get over the frustration of feeling disconnected from the
        web.
      </p>
      <p>It can actually feel like a breath of fresh air.</p>
      <p>
        Once you get used to reading, you can spend an afternoon in relative
        peace, learn something new, and feel rejuvenated instead of exhausted.

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">The Value of Aspiring For More</h2>

      <p>Collecting books helps encourage you to keep learning.</p>
      <p>
        If you don’t already know, continuous learning is basically the thing I
        love the most about being an adult and a business owner. It’s what keeps
        life interesting, and what keeps me inspired to explore and grow as a
        person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Books are basically a fast track to continuous learning. Even at their
        least helpful, they provide an excellent break from screens, media, and
        other hazards of modern life. They’re an amazing tool available to all
        of us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading fiction is a fantastic alternative to watching Netflix, browsing
        social media, or laying around your house. It’s mentally stimulating
        enough that you can get inspired and passionate, and unplugged enough it
        doesn’t feel like work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love reading fiction when I need a break from learning, had a long
        day, or want to relax without spending another hour burning my retinas
        with all the devices and computers in my life I use for work and other
        hobbies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, I read nonfiction to learn the ideas of people I admire, people
        with more expertise than me, who have lived a life I aspire to live, or
        have accomplished things I’d love to accomplish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading, and collecting, nonfiction makes sure you stay humble. The
        existence of unknown knowledge around you is a guaranteed way to remind
        yourself you don’t know everything and that other people are wise in
        ways you aren’t yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning from an accomplished writer is a great way to realize there are
        brilliant people outside your immediate circle and that everyone has
        something to offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having unread books around you keeps you grounded in what you don’t
        know.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either one of those benefits has a massive impact on life, let alone
        both in tandem. Especially when you begin to succeed in your career, and
        your business takes off, it’s easy to think you know enough and that
        you’re complete as a person. That’s a dangerous fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Building a personal library is like an anchor to reality: you’re never
        complete, never too smart to learn something new, and always aware of
        how much more is still out there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the most successful busines people of all time, like Charlie
        Munger, spoke often about reading and how it enriched their lives.

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">A Life Full of Learning</h2>

      <p>
        When you read a book by someone, you’re essentially getting the
        distilled version of everything they’ve learned and thought about a
        subject in a clear, digestible form. That’s pretty amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine being able to inherit all of
        <a
          href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11084145-steve-jobs"
          target="_blank"
          rel="external"
          >Steve Jobs’ design genius
        </a>
        by reading a book, or learn the business prowess of the
        <a

          target="_blank"
          rel="external">founder of Nike, Phil Knight</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are tons of ways to learn something, and while not all of them
        relate to books, those who take the time to write books are often giving
        us a shortcut to a better future.
      </p>
      <p>
        It takes an incredible amount of work to write a book. Even ignoring the
        actual process of writing, painstakingly, each chapter and weaving
        together the information, the research and intention alone is
        awe-inspiring. Writing nonfiction means you have to research your
        topics, fact-check yourself, and make sure you’re accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s hard work. Unbelievably hard. Meaning when a great nonfiction book
        comes out of someone with a genuine expertise or passion for a subject,
        the content within is invaluable. It’s an opportunity to dive into
        something you want to learn at a level you haven’t felt yet.
      </p>

    <section id="subsection-4" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">Books are Beautiful</h2>

      <p>
        There are a lot of reasons to love books. I’ll even include that I think
        books make beautiful decorations, and that a well-stocked bookshelf (or,
        even better, a library) is a great way to organize not only knowledge,
        but also your home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading doesn't have to be for everyone. I understand. If you’ve given
        it a real shot, and you don’t enjoy it, then by all means go out into
        the world and live through actions or whatever it is that connects with
        you better.
      </p>
      <p>That said, I really think it’s worth an exploration.</p>
      <p>
        I can’t honestly overstate how meaningful it is to have books in your
        life, and in your vicinity. It’s a subtle shift in mentality that will
        slowly overtake you and improve you as time goes on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Books are beautiful. Knowledge is beautiful. There’s nothing quite like
        it.
