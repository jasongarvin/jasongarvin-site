      <p>
        Fun fact: I like to write ridiculous blog titles when I’m first drafting
        each post to get myself excited and beat writer's block by putting
        something on the page right away.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a lot of tiny habits like that I’ve picked up from the past
        year.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s right&mdash;I’ve been doing this for a year! 12 blog posts, the
        occasional Threads quip, and side-eye in the direction of LinkedIn with
        a hint of curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve gone so much further with writing in the last year that I thought
        possible when I started. At first, I didn't plan to blog at all. I just
        wanted to launch a personal website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I thought, “maybe I’ll write some articles here and there.” I
        didn’t commit to writing monthly until later. You can tell by the
        awkward 60-day gap in between my first two posts.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s been a long time since then. I own Total Escape Games now. The
        store migrated off Wix (finally) to WordPress, and I did a complete
        website redesign. I’m learning JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js and may
        end up rewriting this whole site.
      </p>
      <p>Things are going well, and there’s a ton I’ve learned.</p>
      <p>
        For example, hand-coding a website and trying to write blog posts on it
        at the same time is way more difficult than I thought. A blogging
        framework has tools in place to index your posts, let you write them in
        markdown, and myriad other options. It’s so nice.
      </p>
      <p>
        By comparison, this is all vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ES6. I’m
        hand-coding every single page with no shortcuts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I coded it this way last summer as a learning experience, because I like
        to explore new skills from the bottom up and gain a strong understanding
        of the fundamentals. For that, I’m thankful I took the vanilla approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, as I publish more and more posts, the website gets
        more difficult to maintain. I’m going to have to figure out a better
        long-term solution, and fast.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, even if you have a background in software, it may be better to
        prioritize your writing by using a pre-buitd solution like
        <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Ghost</a>,
        or at least a static site framework like
        <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Vue</a>
        or
        <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="external">React</a>.
        You can even use
        <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Jekyl</a>
        through GitHUb for something bare-bones to quickly get up and running. Just
        saying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vanilla isn’t the way, in my opinion, even though I’m glad I did it.

        Writing is Unpredictable and Hard to Tame
      </h2>

      <p>
        I really love to write. I’d forgotten how much I enjoyed the craft until
        I got into blogging.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s been years since I was in school, since I was a teaching assistant
        for 300-level composition. Since I wrote academic papers on Psychology
        and argumentative essays on current events.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back then, I wanted to be an author and write novels. For a while I even
        challenged myself to write a new short story every month. I completed
        three
        <a href="https://nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank" rel="external"
          >National Novel Writing Months</a
        >, and have tons and tons of story scraps all over my harddrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        But between then and now, I took nearly half a decade away from the
        hobby.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if everything else was going terribly, I’d be thankful that
        blogging reconnected me with my love for writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m happy to say, though, that it’s not going terribly! I’ve written
        some posts I’m proud of, that delve deep into topics I’m an expert in,
        and that I hope are helpful to you when trying to navigate the tricky
        terrain of productivity or business ownership.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, I think I’ve been too loose about it the past few months.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I first got into writing, I decided to let myself explore a broad
        range of topics and approaches. Short articles, long articles, teaching
        articles, opinion pieces, whatever. It was all fair game. That worked at
        first, because it let me feel things out.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I think that freedom has made it hard to narrow things down, and
        often makes my life difficult when it's time to choose a topic each
        month.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t know if it comes across, but I have about a billion different
        interests. It’s hard enough prioritizing them in my everyday life, let
        alone picking between them all for each blog post.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of the time I think I choose poorly. Which isn’t to say my posts
        are bad, or that you shouldn’t read them (you should), but rather that
        some of the topics are boring. I’m realizing that if I’m bored writing
        them, you’re probably bored reading them. Even when they’re informative.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, for the next year, I'm going to choose more interesting topics, or
        at least explore boring topics in an interesting way. I think I have
        more personality and creativity than I often put into words, and one of
        my weaknesses is getting that across over text.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s hard being vulnerable on the internet. Writing authentically, in my
        own voice, with my own ideas, is vulnerable. It’s something I’ve
        struggled with a lot in the past, and something I’m still working to
        overcome even on social media.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s my challenge to myself for the next year: write about things I
        care about in an interesting way with my personality showing through.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-2" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">Art is Beautiful</h2>

      <p>
        Besides actually writing this blog, though, there’s so much more good
        that’s come from this habit, and that I’m thankful to have in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way life has felt for the last year is way different than how it
        felt before I had a writing outlet, and this consistency has led to tons
        of other healthy habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        I journal pretty regularly these days. Sometimes those entries become
        Threads, or blog posts, or new tasks to accomplish at the store. It’s a
        great way to reflect and let my feelings out so I can review everything
        later and find the useful bits. It helps me unwind at night and let go
        of whatever’s been bouncing around in my head all day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Writing is beautiful. It’s an amazing way to collect your thoughts and
        explore ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m also doing art of different types again. Not just writing, but
        drawing, painting, photography, everything. It’s amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
        It feels like, to some extent, my creativity has been unbottled. I've
        been so focused on business and growth and productivity for a long time
        now that I think I lost touch with my creative side. Writing has helped
        bring that back to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plus, look, I’m a chatty person. Having an outlet for my thousands of
        words where I can explore ideas to my heart's content and publish them
        for you to enjoy makes me happy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-3" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">Rambling, But in a Good Way</h2>

      <p>
        I get off topic and tangent easily. Which is funny, because I’ve spent
        so much time doing research papers and technical writing that you’d
        think I’d be used to sticking to a narrow, rigorous scope when I write.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you give me a blank page of a website for me to fill, though? Oh,
        man.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, if you’re reading this, then thank you. It means a lot to me that
        you took time out of your busy life to read my long-winded ramblings. I
        hope some what I've shared so far has been helpful to you, and I'm glad
        you're here.
      </p>
      <p>For next year, I’d like to double down.</p>
      <p>
        More interesting posts. More thoughtful writing. More personality. More
        vulnerability. I want to keep delivering even better posts in an even
        more helpful way.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s what I’ve learned from the past year, and what I’d like to
        reinvest into the next one. Writing interesting and authentic articles
        is damn hard. That's undeniable. But I've realized
        <b
          >when it gets hard is when it’s the most worth leaning into something.</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve written a lot in the past, and I always took a break around that
        point, and that's a shame. Because I think all the best gains and best
        experiences in life come after scaling that wall.
      </p>
      <p>So, I better get climbing.</p>
