        Ever feel like your life is a hamster wheel of procrastination powered
        by Netflix and snacks? Me too. But fear not, there's a way out, and it
        involves something more powerful than sheer willpower: habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of this as your <em>habit-forming hackathon</em>, where we'll go
        far beyond the unhelpful "just do it" mantras and dig deep into the
        science of habit forming to plan strategies that work for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's transform those daunting goals into automatic routines that
        empower you to achieve lasting change, and finally conquer that mountain
        of laundry (or whatever your personal Everest may be).
      </p>
      <p>
        Ditch the sweatpants and grab your coffee–it's time to harness the power
        of habits to become the unstoppable, productive human you were always
        meant to be.

        <h3>ADHD and Habits</h3>
        <p>
          I am profoundly <em>not an expert on ADHD</em>. My friends with ADHD
          helped me craft this post, but it's still possible some of the steps
          to come may feel, like, raid-boss level difficult at times.
        </p>
        <p>
          If that happens to you, it's okay! You'll find your rhythm with time
          and attention. Try to be patient with yourself at each step of the
          habit-forming process, even if it doesn't go right the first time.

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">Setting Meaningful Goals</h2>

      <p>
        Have you ever made a New Year's resolution?
        <a
          href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2980864/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="external">According to recent research</a
        >, while 77% of people can follow through on these goals for a week,
        only 19% found success across two years. This means you and I are not
        alone in shrugging off our new commitments by January 12th.
      </p>
      <p>
        The good news is, it’s not our fault! Well, sort of, anyway. The problem
        with New Year’s resolutions as a generalization is they often lack
        concrete measurements of success or the goal stretches too far into the
        future. For example, "I'm going to blog this year,” or “I’m going to
        start exercising.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last two years, I’ve become a mastermind of new habit
        formation. It’s almost too good. Sometimes I start doing something
        casually for the fun of it and before I know it, that thing’s been
        absorbed into my routine. Coincidentally, I’ve also set exactly zero New
        Year’s resolutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do this by focusing on adding <strong>one thing at a time</strong>
        into my routine until it's automatic. Most recently, that’s been writing
        (and by extension, blogging). When I recently started this process with writing,
        my goal was to write once a week. I didn’t set an amount of writing. A paragraph
        was the same as an essay as an entire chapter book in fulfilling the goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then it escalated to twice a week with the same rules. Then twice a week
        with the requirement to write at least a paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, three months later, I consistently write 3 to 5 times per week
        without even thinking about it, and I am training myself to focus that
        more towards blog posts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't take my word for it, either. You can
        <a href="/blog/posts/2023-in-review">read my review of 2023</a>
        for a deeper exploration of what worked (and didn't) in my life last year.
      </p>
      <p>
        To generalize my approach, let's break down building a new habit into
        the following steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Set a modest, achievable, and measurable goal. This should be easy to
          accomplish. It’s about confidence building.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pick a time and place each day where you’ll work towards the goal. (If
          you need help with this, you can
          <a href="/blog/posts/navigating-time-as-a-business-owner"
            >read more about managing your time</a
          >
          to become more effective at prioritizing new tasks).
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue to achieve that goal for a few weeks. Notice how good it
          feels to achieve your goal. Live in that excitement and compliment
          your dedication.
        </li>
        <li>
          Increase the scope of the goal. Add another day each week of that
          activity, or increase the intensity. Keep it achievable and small, but
          larger than it used to be.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once again reinforce your success, and address roadblocks if you slip.
          Keep trying until you consistently achieve this goal for 3-5 weeks.
        </li>
        <li>Increase the intensity further towards your goal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What if you don’t have a larger goal for it to feed into? Thankfully,
        you don’t need one. In my case, I had a focused endpoint, but if
        creating the new habit is the endpoint, then the above is enough to get
        you most of the way there.

        For some people, it’ll be less, and for others, it’ll be much longer. Your
        job, throughout that process, is to stay as consistent as possible.

      <p>Okay, so easier said than done, right?</p>
      <p>
        In my experience, getting the ball rolling is the hardest part. That’s
        why this blog includes the title “Overcoming Inertia,” instead of
        “Casually Rolling to Success,” or something else fluffy-sounding.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’ve ever moved furniture out of a rut in the carpet, you know from
        experience. The first motion out of your resting place is the hardest.
        Your resting place might be an established routine, a lie you’re telling
        yourself, or an overburdening of commitments that leave you feeling
        paralyzed.
      </p>
      <p>
        All is not lost, however. There are some tried and true methods to take
        that first step and begin building momentum. The best news of all is
        that momentum is surprisingly hard to lose once you have it. To parallel
        the earlier article about
        <a
          href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3505409/#b22"

        >, did you know it’s equally (or even more) difficult to
        <a
          href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9117234/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="external">break a habit</a
        >?
      </p>
      <p>
        For this, let’s look at how writers and artists overcome a blank page:
        make a mark, any mark, and remove the decision paralysis from the
        equation altogether. I believe that the first mark is similar to the
        first push of momentum. By removing the paralysis of infinite
        possibilities, you help yourself narrow down to what matters most.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach works for more than just creative pursuits. Sometimes the
        only way to start really is by starting, plain and simple. If you can
        get over the initial activation energy required to start the activity,
        you'll be amazed how much further that momentum often carries you.

        <p>
          Using AI this way allows it to make the first move, and allows me to
          neatly slide into the momentum it creates without expending that
          energy, myself. While I'll caution you against using AI-generated
          output without review, it’s an incredible tool for getting started.

        There are other methods that use external momentum to lead us towards
        habit formation, too. If taking the first step yourself is too much, try
        leaning on others' motivation instead.

        There’s a fascinating trend lately called

        yourself to stay focused. Sitting beside someone (or even in the same
        room) as someone doing work encourages you to get productive as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, working in a public space works for some people. With me, for
        example, if I sit in a coffee shop I'm less likely to get distracted
        because I feel social pressure from those around me that makes goofing
        off feel undesirable.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's no end to methods you can try when building new hobbies. Get
        your friends and family involved, make it silly, follow a pre-determined
        routine from the internet. What matters is finding a method that works
        best for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try out the suggestions here, but don't be afraid to innovate. More
        important than following my exact routine, or these exact steps, is
        learning more about yourself and what helps you take the first step.

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">Learning to Achieve Flow</h2>

      <p>
        If you’ve been on the internet in, oh, the last few years, you’ve
        probably come across the idea of flow. Especially common amongst
        programmers, artists, and athletes, flow is essentially the state of
        losing yourself in an activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people have studied flow, and there’s a great deal of information
        available on the physiological and neurological changes that happen
        <a
          href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.645498/full"
          target="_blank"
          rel="nofollow external">when someone enters flow</a
        >. Yet, getting yourself into flow is more difficult than the research
        might suggest, and simultaneously way easier than you’re anticipating.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first step is not to overthink. Thinking about flow is maddeningly
        likely to make it less likely you achieve it. Thinking about anything
        too much makes it hard to enter flow. When we spend our time thinking,
        we’re focused internally, whereas flow requires external focus on a task
        or process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without engaging with the outside world, you’ll struggle to reach flow
        and, thus, struggle to become as productive as you’d like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Flow helps develop healthy habits, and to grow the habits we already
        have. Say I’ve started blogging–I’ve taken that first step–and now I
        need to perform. Flow is how I go from writing little bits of blogs over
        several weeks to banging out an entire draft in an afternoon. It’s also
        how to have great editing sessions, develop new features, design a logo,
        or train for a marathon.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, we know why it’s helpful and how to not achieve flow, but how do we
        get ourselves into this magical state?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          First, we engage in an activity we’re familiar with, that we know
          intrinsically and don’t have to think to accomplish. The phrase “like
          riding a bike” comes to mind, where once you’ve learned it you don’t
          have to think it through each time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, we have to focus on that activity. If we’re multitasking or
          overthinking, we’re an obstacle to ourselves.
        </li>
        <li>
          The activity then has to be appropriately difficult. If it’s too easy
          we get bored or distracted, and if it’s too hard we get frustrated,
          hit roadblocks, and give up. Finding the edge of what you can do and
          what you can’t do is essential to flow.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, it's time to focus on completing that activity to the best of
          your ability, challenges and all.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Flow is essential not only in overcoming inertia but also in excelling
        at a new hobby once we’ve taken the first steps and feel more familiar.
        Flow helps us overcome the feeling of stagnation that comes from doing
        something repeatedly without pushing ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        In turn, pushing ourselves helps us overcome future roadblocks by
        maintaining discipline and momentum in our lives.
      </p>

    <section id="subsection-4" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
        Becoming Resistant to Distraction
      </h2>

      <p>
        By this point in the process, we know how to get started, we know how to
        pursue challenges, and we know why challenging ourselves makes us better
        at the habits we're building. That's our foundation done!
      </p>
      <p>The last piece, truly, is consistency.</p>
      <p>
        I’ve known some gifted artists. Artists who, when they apply themselves,
        create works of art that easily rival anything I’ve seen online with
        hundreds of thousands of views. But they don’t get those views. They
        don’t get much of anything, really.
      </p>
      <p>Why does that happen?</p>
      <p>
        It comes down to two things: lack of discipline and/or lack of
        consistency, which are two sides of the same coin.
      </p>
      <p>
        You're unlikely to be consistent if you’re not disciplined&mdash;if you
        can’t overcome discomfort and hold yourself accountable, you’ll struggle
        to keep yourself on track. Conversely, if you aren’t consistent then
        it’s difficult to be disciplined because you keep changing focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        While talent and skill certainly play a role in success, and in
        overcoming inertia through sheer confidence, they’re not enough to help
        us build a habit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Instead, we need to maintain ourselves.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Discipline comes from accountability. There’s a
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PafvhTSC4yE"
          target="_blank"
          rel="external"
          >great Diary of a CEO episode
        </a>
        on this with an expert in the subject, Ryan Holiday, that I strongly recommend
        if you can spare the 90 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your ability to stay disciplined comes from holding yourself to your own
        goals, values, and expectations. If you identify as an early riser,
        you’re way more likely to get up early. Similarly, if you snooze your
        alarm every morning and sleep in, you’re not holding yourself
        accountable to your ideals and will slip from them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some would suggest an action as simple as making your bed in the morning
        makes you significantly more likely to stay accountable and get things
        done throughout the day. I’ve personally found success with this, but
        not enough to peddle it here. Feel free to try it out for yourself and
        see how it feels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, focus your attention on your actions and make sure they match
        your intentions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you can do that, you can stay consistent. Consistency arises from a
        desire to repeatedly do a task, or at least achieve the outcome by
        working diligently on that task and sticking to it. If you keep yourself
        accountable, you’ll stay in the pocket of your goal and are thus
        significantly more likely to accomplish it.
      </p>

    <section id="subsection-5" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">Sticking to the Plan</h2>

      <p>
        There it is. That's the formula to overcome inertia and get rolling with
        new hobbies and goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's recap each step just briefly for memory's sake before I say
        goodbye:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set realistic, achievable goals to strive towards</li>
        <li>Take the first step to avoid inaction and paralysis</li>
        <li>Get used to repeating that step, get comfortable, and find flow</li>
        <li>Build the habit with consistency and discipline</li>
        <li>Achieve your goals and build confidence</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When reading through this it might seem like a lot, and in a sense it
        can get rather complex, but it doesn't have to for you to achieve your
        goals. Building a habit can be fun, and it's always a learning
        experience. Embrace the journey, and you'll do just fine.
      </p>

        See, a lot of the process happens automatically if you’re heading down
        the right path. It’s built into who we are as humans. If you haven’t
        formed any habits already, then you’re also not brushing your teeth or
        taking care of yourself in other ways, which seems more important
        anyway.

        Your body knows what to do. It’s designed to build habits, from your
        nervous system to your muscles, and <em>especially your brain</em>. A
        lot of the processing our brain does in a day is due to habits, or
        heuristics, that help us get through the day without succumbing to
        information overload. Especially in the modern world, with information
        at our fingertips.

        Remember, consistency is worth more than anything at this step. Even if
        you don’t feel proud of your accomplishments, keep trying. You’ll be
        amazed how far sticking to a goal will get you over time. You'll get
        there!

      <p>Good luck building your habits, and I’ll see you next time.</p>
