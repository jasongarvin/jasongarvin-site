        This year was hard. Really hard. I wrote a different version of this
        post originally, but it came off too shallow. I wrote of numbers, of
        data and statistics, but the human version of my story throughout 2023
        was conspicuously missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider this to be that human version. Though I’ll include some data,
        the numbers only tell part of the tale. Instead, I want to focus on what
        I achieved this year, and what I learned that I can take forward into
        the new year.
      </p>
      <p>
        My year was about perseverance and the value of making small,
        incremental improvements over time. It was also about exploring my
        purpose, my “life’s work,” so to speak, and how the trials I endured
        this year led me closer than ever to finding it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though this is a review of my own personal experience this year, I hope
        you'll find some helpful tidbits you can apply to your own life!
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-1" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
        Setting
        <span class="emphasis">Intentions</span>
      </h2>

      <p>
        As 2023 began, I wasn’t in a great mental space. I was in an unhealthy
        spot in my relationship, was beginning to think I’d never get to own the
        business I’d poured myself into for six years, and had a complete and
        staggering lack of purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faced with a future of uncertainty, one where I wasn’t sure if I’d
        continue to have my partner, my house, or even my job, I had to start
        figuring things out. I knew I could stay at my job, but I didn’t know if
        it was the right choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same went for my relationship, and other lingering elements of my
        life I hadn’t come to terms with yet, but desperately needed to face.
      </p>
      <p>I started by trying to find my purpose.</p>
      <p>
        The truth is, I had no idea how to face those decisions at the time, let
        alone how to make the right choices. I didn’t know where I was trying to
        go. I would get so stuck each time, paralyzed by the fear of what could
        go wrong, that I’d forget to look at the potential upside.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, when I was setting goals for the year, that’s exactly what my focus
        was: I wanted to figure out my purpose, and who I wanted to become.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m turning 30 next year, which I'm honestly kind of excited about, but
        it got me thinking nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew that I loved being a dad, and that supporting our family was
        important to me. He was the light of my life, in addition of course to
        his mom and our cat. Really, I think becoming a dad irrevocably changed
        my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        See, before I became a dad I didn’t have much direction or care. I was
        depressed and kind of drifting, even when I liked my life and the things
        in it. I didn’t think much of the future and kept kicking the can down
        the road about where I was going and what my purpose would be.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I became a dad, it made me consider the future in a new way. I
        wasn’t just looking out for myself anymore; people depended on me. That
        ended up being a really healthy thing for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        So for 2023, I figured I should get it all sorted out. I was watching my
        son start to find his opinions&mdash;his preferences&mdash;and live
        according to his own interests, and it inspired me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still wanted to own Total Escape Games, but after waiting for years to
        become an owner as we hit roadblock after roadblock, I’d begun to
        realize it might not happen and that I needed to start considering
        alternatives. I'd been preparing to move into the tech industry already
        since 2020, and decided to lean further into that.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I started learning web development to support the Fill and Fire team
        better and assume more responsibility. I’d been learning Python already
        but was struggling to find practical applications for it besides data
        science and ML, which wasn’t so much my interest. Web development was
        full of applications&mdash;the ability to create a website on my own was
        exciting.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the year, I set a single rule. “Figure out where I’m going in life,”
        I told myself. This was the year of decisions. I was going to start
        building momentum and roll myself out of the rut I’d worn in over the
        years of struggling against outside influences.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
        Embarking on a
        <span class="emphasis">Journey</span>
      </h2>

      <p>
        Finding my purpose was no easy task. I tried (and consumed) a great deal
        of ideas, read an enormous amount of content, and packed my days
        unreasonably busy in hopes that the things I valued would stick out.
      </p>
      <p>
        I only started taking notes on every article and video I consumed late
        into the year to begin building my knowledge base (great advice I got
        from reading
        <a href="https://nesslabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external"
          >Anne-Laure Le Cunff’s articles</a
        >), but even with it starting in October I have notes for over 75
        sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        To figure out my personal life, and the tasks I value, I settled on
        trying to draw more, write more, read more, study (and code) every day,
        find a stretching routine that actually worked, and spend lots of time
        in meditation. I wasn’t sure if all of it would stick, but I figured
        trying each thing for a few weeks would quickly tell me if I enjoyed it
        and was willing to make time for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I added one activity at a time, giving it room to become a part of my
        routine (or fall off the planet) before adding the next task. As of
        writing this, I’m up to 8 activities I do every day and 2-3 more I do a
        few times a week.
      </p>

      <aside class="bonus-content">
        <h3>A Different Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Next time, rather than do a little bit of a lot of things each day,
          I’m going to try spending a couple of weeks dedicated each individual
          activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ll be curious to see if it’s more effective to make incremental
          improvements across a broad number of skills, or to dive deep into one
          skill at a time and stay in a particular area of study for longer.
        </p>
      </aside>

      <p>
        By building good (and healthy) routines, I started to feel better. I
        paired the above goals with eating healthier, quitting energy drinks,
        and sleeping more, which helped enormously in having the energy and
        ability to, you know, actually follow through on that huge list of
        activities I set for myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the year I paid attention to which activities invigorated me versus
        the ones that felt stressful, hard, or unpleasant. It was okay for an
        activity to feel hard or stressful (coding gets that way sometimes for
        sure, and don’t even get me started on learning to draw), but something
        that felt unpleasant was a big warning sign.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I’d really gotten underway trying new things and adding to my
        routine, I felt more productive and confident. I was learning a lot and
        was getting to see myself improve in small increments each week.
      </p>
      <p>
        I strongly believe setting that foundation helped me to make the
        grueling decisions ahead of me for the rest of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Choosing to leave my relationship and break apart the family was an
        immensely difficult decision, and I'll leave it at that. But it was a
        decision I had to commit to, one way or the other, and it feels good to
        at least know I've made it to the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, I realized it was time to move on. It was the hardest
        decision I’ve ever made, and maybe ever will make. I think I'll always
        be grateful we resolved things peacefully, and that I still get to visit
        regularly, see my son (and cat), and even spend fun, happy times with my
        ex-partner.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t think navigating the end of our relationship is a transferable
        skill, nor would I like to repeat the process of separating. But in the
        end, it did push me to figure out what I truly valued in life and carve
        out time/effort for those things, and it especially forced me to be
        willing to make other difficult decisions in my life because, by
        comparison, they were easy.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
        Recapping the
        <span class="emphasis">Year</span>
      </h2>

      <p>
        In the end, I (mostly) came through! I have a stronger sense of purpose,
        and have begun to notice which parts of my life make me happy and which
        ones make me crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, I did a great job cultivating new habits. I followed my
        own advice from my
        <a href="/blog/posts/harnessing-the-power-of-habits"
          >first-ever blog post about building habits</a
        >
        and finished the year feeling confident in my new routine(s).
      </p>
      <p>Throughout the year, I:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Meditated every day</li>
        <li>
          Stretched every day except Sundays (I take one day off each week)
        </li>
        <li>Read <i>something</i> on 330 days</li>
        <li>Drew or designed something on 334 days</li>
        <li>Wrote/edited code on 342 days</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I discovered a new love for web development. I was infatuated with the
        tech industry overall and had been loving the challenges we’d been
        working to overcome with Fill and Fire. But that was UX and Product
        Design. Getting to actually code and implement the interfaces, the
        designs, the animations, and the user experience improvements myself was
        mesmerizing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent a lot of time exploring my drawing habits. What I discovered is
        I don’t like feeling like I <b>have</b> to draw for some kind of deadline,
        but that having specific prompts helps force me to improve. Doing
        <a href="https://inktober.com/" target="_blank" rel="external"
          >Inktober</a
        >
        was an amazing exercise, and while it was pretty stressful, I loved the results
        of what I was able to create.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally making the time to read books was amazing. I love it a lot. Like
        way more than I like reading articles, and especially more than I like
        reading newsletters. The latter is because I realized after subscribing
        to tons of different ones all year that I dislike newsletters on
        average.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found a couple of great newsletters which I still read daily.
        <a href="https://nesslabs.com/newsletter" target="_blank" rel="external"
          >The Maker Mind Newsletter</a
        >
        from Anne-Laure Le Cunff is an excellent resource for getting to know ourselves
        better and setting our lives up for success.
        <a href="https://every.to/" target="_blank" rel="external">Every</a>
        is a beautifully crafted daily newsletter that never fails to surprise and
        delight me (not to mention teach me new ideas).
      </p>
      <p>
        But I probably cut 10-12 others from my routine throughout the year. The
        pressure of having an inbox full of reading every morning was awful,
        stressful, and bad. I started each day feeling behind. So that got cut
        pretty quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ignoring digital content, I also read 8 full books this year. I
        thoroughly enjoyed 6 of them (including
        <a
          href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/30066684"
          target="_blank"
          rel="nofollow external">Star Trek: The Classic Episodes</a
        >), felt okay about one, and hated another. I learned that I enjoy
        nonfiction in moderation, but that not all nonfiction writing is equal,
        and I have no patience for books packed with filler.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, after many years, I managed to get into the groove with daily
        meditations and stretching, and am happy to say I can <i>comfortably</i>
        touch my toes for the first time since I was in high school and actively
        involved in martial arts.
      </p>

        <h3>Managing Time</h3>
        <p>
          In hindsight, a lot of 2023 was about getting the most out of my time.
          It's a topic I later wrote about in a blog post about
          <a href="/blog/posts/navigating-time-as-a-business-owner"
            >navigating time as a business owner</a
          >, which synthesizes a lot of what I learned even before I'd taken
          over the business.

        Finding
        <span class="emphasis">Purpose</span>
      </h2>

      <p>
        It turns out, there’s more to me than being a dad. It also turns out
        that being a dad is really damn important to me. Go figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        My son is still my number one priority, and I'm excited to watch him
        continue to grow, learn, and develop as a person. His happiness is
        infinitely linked to my own, and even in the most challenging of times,
        having him in my life helps push me forward and encourages me to be the
        best version of myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's been hard balancing my ambitions against being in his life often
        enough for him to feel secure, but it's a balancing act I must learn to
        master. Though I've discovered a strong passion for business and
        entrepreneurship this year, I refuse to be an absentee parent, and am
        keeping that top-of-mind as I continue to progress in my career.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, as this post is published, I am officially one of
        three owners of Total Escape Games, joined by two long-time business
        partners and dear friends of mine! It feels like a new chapter of my
        life has just begun, like this is a moment I’ll remember deep into my
        later years.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can learn more about what I learned throughout
        <a href="/blog/posts/buying-a-business"
          >the process of buying a business in a more recent post of mine</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        I feel a great sense of purpose and accomplishment in the work I’ve done
        for the store, both in building a great experience for customers and in
        learning to become a good, ethical manager who takes care of his team.
        Getting to finally own the business is a huge breath of fresh air, and
        has revitalized my excitement to keep running the store.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that in mind, another piece of my purpose-puzzle is building
        community and creating great experiences. I deeply enjoy achieving big
        goals through my business prowess and growing industry knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        I reconnected with my Psychology degree throughout this year, finding
        new parallels between what I learned in school and UX, business
        leadership, marketing, and effective website design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tying all those pieces together helped me realize I do love Psychology,
        just not in the clinical sense. I value practical Psychology, easily
        applied to life’s problems and goals, rather than the overly cerebral
        conceptual Psychology of higher education.
      </p>
      <p>
        By combining all of the different disciplines I explored this year, I
        came out of the crucible with a new understanding of how all my
        seemingly-divergent interests interweave. This funneled into a single
        idea: experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I truly value, and what gets me more excited than anything else, is
        creating things that elicit a certain reaction from others. This applies
        to building websites, designing good UX, revising procedures and
        workflows, and writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Really, as long as I can create things, and those things make other
        people feel, I’m happy.

        Looking
        <span class="emphasis">Ahead</span>
      </h2>

      <p>
        For 2024, I want to focus on community outreach, business growth, and
        creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I’m officially an owner of Total Escape Games, it feels
        appropriate to spend the year focusing on business growth. I want to see
        TEG modernize, both in branding (it’s 15 years old and due for a
        facelift) and in operations. I think we’re already in a good spot, but I
        want to become truly excellent.
      </p>
      <p>By focusing on business, I’m starting to build my life’s work.</p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I want to connect with the local small business
        community in Broomfield, Colorado. I want to join the local chamber of
        commerce, spend more time partnering up with business owners in the
        area, and help grow the community with my expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m also excited to learn from the incredible business owners in the
        area.
      </p>
      <p>
        By engaging with the community, getting to know other professionals in
        the area, and providing valuable services to the people around me, I can
        also contribute to my budding life’s work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I want to expand my creative outlets. I’m already working to
        become proficient at using Adobe Illustrator, and have been using
        InDesign a lot more, which means I get to create more graphics and
        design elements for work and my other projects. I also want to create
        some cool personal pieces of art, and have already queued up a 30-day
        drawing exercise for next year.

        Drawing
        <span class="emphasis">Conclusions</span>
      </h2>

      <p>
        At the beginning of 2023, I thought the world was more black and white.
        I felt like things were either good or bad, and decisions were either
        right or wrong. I agonized over making the “right” decisions and
        choosing the “good” things.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I’ve realized, however, is that often things exist more on a
        spectrum than a binary scale. Decisions tend to be neither right nor
        wrong, and either choice has consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being able to realize this truth has helped me get unstuck and start
        moving forward again. I made some difficult choices this year, and those
        decisions freed me up to explore my future.
      </p>
      <p>
        That freedom helped me make incremental changes to my life, explore my
        own history and mind, and find a deep passion for the human experience.
        I’ve begun to walk the path ahead of me towards my life’s work.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I had to leave you with one takeaway from this year, one piece of
        advice if you’re experiencing any of the struggles I’ve felt, it’s this:
        <strong>just make a decision</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The agony leading up to the decision is usually far worse than the
        consequences and clean-up of the decision itself. And you can’t move
        forward, and find what you love in life, if you’re not willing to make
        hard choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        So start making decisions. Try a new food. Explore a new hobby. Visit a
        new place. Then, if you love it, lean in. If you don’t, make the
        decision to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just, whatever you do, try to make the choice yourself. Because if you
        don’t, I've discovered the people and circumstances around you tend to
        eventually make them for you.
      </p>
      <p>Remember: life is what you make of it, and it’s your story to tell.</p>
      <p>Happy New Year, and may we all find success in 2024!</p>
