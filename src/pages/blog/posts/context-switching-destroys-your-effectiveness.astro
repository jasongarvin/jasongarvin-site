        I did an audit recently of every task I do throughout the day and my
        mental state. The results were horrifying.
      </p>
      <p>What I discovered is, essentially, this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I change tasks way too frequently, often not by choice.</li>
        <li>I get mentally fatigued as the day goes on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It turns out that when I have to totally reframe my mind and spend time
        jumping into a new task over, and over, and over again, I get tired and
        less effective.
      </p>
      <p>Chances are good you might be suffering from this, too.</p>
      <p>
        Context switching, also known as the insidious process of mentally
        hopping from bucket to bucket, is exhausting. It makes you spend time
        orienting yourself to new tasks way more times in a day than you should,
        and it’s destructive.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let’s talk about it. How do you, or I, avoid it? What can we do to
        mitigate its effects when we can’t avoid it?
      </p>
      <p>
        After realizing the toll it was taking on my work efficiency and mental
        health, I went on a deep dive to understand this mysterious beast and
        hopefully slay it for good.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">Describing Context Switching</h2>

      <p>
        So what is context switching, exactly? Basically, it’s the act of
        switching from one knowledge space–context–to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contexts are specific topics, tasks, or processes you’re operating
        within. Sometimes that can be as broad as “marketing” or as specific as
        “buying collectible card games.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Switching between contexts comes in many forms, but most commonly
        happens when you’re trying to focus on a long-form task and get
        interrupted by urgent communications, meetings, or other time-sensitive
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my own life, it often comes from switching between trying to write
        procedures and checking out customers, or taking a break from designing
        our website to offer board game recommendations.
      </p>
      <p>
        At times it’s just a minor setback, but it can also totally derail work
        and force us to reacquaint ourselves with certain tasks or knowledge
        multiple times.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some great resources throughout this article that go deeper
        into the different mechanisms behind context switching, how it works,
        and why it can affect us so negatively. I highly recommend them all if
        you like understanding topics deeply.
      </p>

      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">We’re Pretty Much All Doing It</h2>

      <p>
        It’s not just me. Increasingly, knowledge workers are realizing the pain
        of context switching and the toll it takes on their productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t just take my word for it. Here’s a piece by productivity app Asana
        about
        <a
          href="https://asana.com/resources/context-switching"
          target="_blank"
          rel="external">the dangers of context switching</a
        >. From their article, 56% of employees feel pressure to check
        notifications immediately, and use up to 9 different apps each day.
        That’s so many apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally,
        <a
          href="https://ics.uci.edu/~gmark/chi08-mark.pdf"
          target="_blank"
          rel="external"
          >a study from the University of California, Irvine
        </a>
        shows that after 20 minutes of interruption, stress and frustration skyrocket.
      </p>
      <p>
        These metrics paint a bleak picture of how easy it is to be interrupted
        and, ultimately, be forced to switch contexts. Asana recommends some
        simple ways to try to mitigate interruption, including putting on Do Not
        Disturb and trying not to get derailed by notifications as much.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those methods help, but they don’t address the full picture. The reality
        of context switching goes much deeper than just avoiding pesky
        notifications and using a
        <a

          rel="external">feels similarly about context switching</a
        >. They wrote an incredibly in-depth article that’s a great read if
        you’re looking to really, thoroughly understand a lot of the complicated
        parts of context switching.
      </p>
      <p>
        The long and the short of it is that context switching affects
        everything. It hurts your efficiency because you can’t batch your work
        as well. It hurts your effectiveness because you get distracted and have
        a hard time achieving flow. It hurts your mental health, which hurts
        literally everything else.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-3" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
        You Can’t Avoid Context Switching
      </h2>

      <p>
        In a perfect world, you would finish all your tasks in a specific
        context before moving on to anything else. You’d get plenty of time for
        deep work, achieve flow for any and all skill-based tasks, and your days
        would play out exactly as planned.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our current fast-paced world, and especially if you’re a business
        owner, this doesn’t tend to happen. Instead, we switch contexts back and
        forth, leading to mental fatigue and potentially burnout.
      </p>
      <p>
        The world doesn’t play by your rules, or keep us from getting
        distracted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes it’s an onslaught of notifications, while other times it’s
        factors entirely out of your control like construction outside the
        window or a coworker calling in sick causing you to be responsible for
        extra load.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because a lot of the triggers for context switching are built deeply
        into our lives–phones, email, apps, social obligations, and work
        expectations&mdash;it’s difficult to tune all that out and get to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, we have to get creative when managing context switching to
        avoid burnout. There are a lot of techniques and approaches, all
        depending on where you work and how you work best.
      </p>
      <p>
        To set the expectation: context switching isn’t going away. It’s too
        fundamental to how we work and communicate in the modern age. Instead,
        our best bet is to manage how much of it we allow into our lives and
        when.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-4" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">Keep Tasks Location-Specific</h2>

      <p>
        From my own experience, sometimes the solution is to just just, plain
        and simple, work somewhere else. Sometimes I need to get the
        administrative work done another time than when I’m managing the front
        of the store.
      </p>
      <p>
        When this is possible, it’s a great way to avoid context switching. This
        happens simply by planning your tasks around possible interventions and
        changing your location to avoid distractions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have kids at home and need to get work done, for example, try
        going into the office, to a coworking space, or a local coffee shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Changing your location can be a great way to manage contexts–keep what
        you do in each space limited to the purpose of that space. You can even
        do this with different rooms in your home.
      </p>
      <p>
        What ends up happening when you stick to this method is each different
        physical location in your life becomes its own context. The coffee shop
        is coding time. Your home office is for email and administrative tasks.
        Your time at work is for upkeep and management.
      </p>
      <p>
        You create new contexts, each a form of bucket for specific tasks, that
        helps you stay focused and minimizes distractions.

        Structure Your Work to Focus Better
      </h2>

      <p>Routines work for a reason.</p>
      <p>
        If you’re context switching a lot, and notice you often jump between
        unrelated tasks that span many genres of work, you might need to plan
        your time better.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, when I know I need to get a lot of work done on our
        website, I intentionally focus 2-3 days of my schedule on digital
        content. During this time, I focus exclusively on our web presence:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Write context marketing and edit copywriting.</li>
        <li>Redesign parts of the website.</li>
        <li>Adjust SEO on pre-order items in our web store.</li>
        <li>Conduct user experience testing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While not all of those are directly parallel in skillset, they all
        relate to the same context: our web presence. Content marketing is more
        about writing and SEO. That blends into the SEO adjustments I make
        elsewhere on the site. While I’m poking around the site, I’ll adjust the
        design in places where I notice it’s rough.
      </p>
      <p>
        User experience testing feeds into all of those categories by giving me
        direct feedback to use when adjusting the site or writing new content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now imagine I also shoved social media, procedure writing, and staff
        evaluations into the mix. Those are wildly different!
      </p>
      <p>
        If I had to pull my nose out of the website to conduct a performance
        review, I’d feel scattered. I’d have spent the first half of the day
        thinking about analytics and marketing, and then have to shift fully
        into manager mode with a focus on goal-setting and interpersonal
        communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, I put managerial tasks and team projects on their own days.
        That way, when I get to work I know immediately it’s a day to flex my
        communication skills and to organize tasks to orient the team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Find the places in your own life where you can put that idea to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t work on marketing on the same days you’re adding new features to
        your service or fixing bugs. Don’t plan meetings for the same days
        you’re trying to review todo lists and build a new schedule of
        priorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        By clumping related tasks together, you’ll avoid context switching even
        though you’ll still be doing all the same tasks, from all the different
        contexts, over the course of your work week.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >Worth noting, not everyone works the same way. I highly recommend at
          least trying my suggestion to batch work, but it is possible you
          genuinely enjoy interweaving your work and switching between different
          tasks. If that’s true, then great!</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >More than anything, managing context switching is about finding the
          process that works for you and limits your personal stress and
          burnout.</i

    <section id="subsection-6" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
        Delegate to Avoid Switching Focus
      </h2>

      <p>
        Trimming down your tasks is a great way to become more efficient and
        organized overall. If you have way too much on your plate, you’ll end up
        context switching no matter what else you try.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why it’s worthwhile to examine your workflow, your tasks, and
        your responsibilities for a given day, week, or even longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, I feel so strongly about time and task management that I wrote
        <a href="/blog/posts/navigating-time-as-a-business-owner"
          >an entire article on managing your time better</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oftentimes, you’ll learn that there are huge chunks of work that are
        inefficient at best, or an absolute nightmare at worst. Sometimes it’s
        because you find yourself spending most of your time on a single task
        each day. Worse is when you don’t need to do that task yourself but have
        been anyway, causing it to eat away at your productivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you evaluate where you spend your time and energy, it becomes clear
        what’s getting in the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, when I dove into my work days, I discovered that the biggest
        source of context switching ended up being the simple fact I was working
        behind the counter. This gave employees and customers immediate access
        to me, and often interrupted me during times of focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        To fix this, I started working from home more, and rearranged shifts so
        that I have more help during the day and am thus more able to step away
        for focused work.
      </p>
      <p>This is where delegation comes into play.</p>
      <p>
        If you have a team, then you’re likely already used to giving tasks to
        others. This is no different. Find the parts of your work that cause the
        most distraction and also generate the least value. Remove those from
        your own plate.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you work by yourself, find tools and services that automate away
        inconveniences you face in your daily life or work routine. For
        instance, use AI to help you brainstorm sales copy you’re not motivated
        to write so you can minimize time spent doing it. Or, use a ticket
        tracking service for bug reports and issues with your software.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you find there’s an entire subset of work you’re doing (say, HR)
        that you have capital enough to hire someone to do instead, it’s often
        worth the tradeoff. Do your financial due diligence, but keep in mind
        that there are benefits to offloading entire sections of work besides
        just monetary ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your peace of mind will let you run a better company, make smarter
        decisions, and avoid burnout.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-7" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">Keep Yourself Accountable</h2>

      <p>
        It’s so easy to get distracted, especially when you work on a computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a million apps that want your attention. Emails. Messages from
        coworkers and employees. Cold calls. Meetings. The list could go on
        forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of managing context switching is to be accountable for your own
        decisions and the distractions you put in your path.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re managing a team, distractions are an inevitable part of your
        job. Learn to accept them and find ways to weave your other tasks into
        your day. After all, being a resource for your team and helping make
        decisions is most of what you should be doing, anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if you’re an individual contributor or, especially, a
        business owner, you have to be willing to ruthlessly clear away
        distractions sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe that means putting your phone on silent. Maybe it means working
        from a place where nobody can physically reach you. If you need to
        download apps that lock down other apps, do it. If you need to put your
        phone in a box at the other end of your house, that’s fair play too.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a certain point, you just can’t let things intervene. It’s hard, and
        the opposite way of how a lot of our notification and ad-driven reality
        want us to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        But detoxing from notifications and being willing to look at something
        and acknowledge it can wait is essential. Even better if you can avoid
        looking at it in the first place until you’re ready to address it.
      </p>
      <p>Build the discipline to restrict yourself and your context.</p>

        Final Words Against Context Switching
      </h2>

      <p>
        Really and truly you should be doing everything you can to minimize
        context switching. It’s going to burn you out. It’s burnt me out before.
      </p>
      <p>Sometimes you just can’t avoid it. Urgent matters come up.</p>
      <p>
        Go attend your kid’s concert recital, or take them to a birthday party.
        Go out with your friends. Interrupt your work day to get lunch with an
        old colleague. In fact, it’s so important you let yourself be carried
        away by unexpected things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just, whenever possible, have ways to address it. Get off work early on
        the days you have long evening plans. Schedule other meetings and social
        tasks around your lunch outing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Context switching should be treated like an angry boss. It should be
        every bit as frustrating as the worst parts of your worst jobs. In fact,
        a lot of bad managers force us to switch contexts often, and that ends
        up being part of why we resent them so much.
      </p>
      <p>
        We won’t fully escape context switching, and that’s okay. Our brains can
        handle it. Our phones can handle it. We have apps to mitigate it.
      </p>
      <p>
        By doing everything we can to minimize it, and by ensuring we give
        ourselves large periods of time whenever possible to focus, we can
        maintain our productivity and continue to put out great work and run
        great companies.
