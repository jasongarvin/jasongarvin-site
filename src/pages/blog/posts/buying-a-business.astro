        If there were ever a process as daunting in practice as it is in theory,
        it’s business acquisition and transition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between city, county, state, and federal laws, there’s a whole lot to
        unpack, and major parts of the process can feel vague. The government,
        on average, has an archaic labyrinth of documentation and is in
        desperate need of a UX Designer. Which is to say, the information is
        there, but you might spend lots of time trying to find it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recent legislation in the US has only complicated things. These days,
        most providers will force you to close existing accounts only to reopen
        new, identical ones under your own credentials. If you’re like me and
        buy a business with a lot of accounts, this becomes an enormous lift and
        is also totally unavoidable.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that in mind, while you can and will learn a great deal throughout
        the process of buying a business, some information is still helpful to
        have in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve broken down the process into 6 steps based on my recent experience
        with buying a local retail business. Your situation may vary, especially
        depending on whether you buying a physical business or a digital one,
        whether it has employees or not, and how old it is, but these 6 give you
        a good place to start.
      </p>

      <ol class="list-spaced">
        <li>
          <b>Do your due diligence.</b>
          How much does the business make in annual revenue? What are its expenses
          and liabilities? Is it well-positioned in the market, does it have strong
          branding, or will you need to rework it?
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Learn about the day-to-day operations.</b>
          If you can, ask to spend some time shadowing management. Ask questions
          about typical day-to-day activities. Where does the owner spend most of
          their time, and what are the key tasks they prioritize?
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Research the industry.</b>
          Put simply, what is the industry like and what kind of problems can you
          expect to face?
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Understand the competitive landscape.</b>
          How many competitors should you expect, and how cutthroat is it? Does this
          business have a lot of competition, or is it an open field? Does it have
          a unique advantage that others lack?
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Recognize its dependencies.</b>
          What are the tools and platforms the business needs to operate? If you
          can understand its infrastructure before you’re in the driver’s seat, you'll
          be more prepared to drive it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Compile a transition checklist.</b>
          What does the outgoing owner need to do before and after the sale, and
          what must you handle? This may include account updates, banking changes,
          state and federal form filings, and more.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        By resolving those 6 items ahead of time, you’ll have a more
        comprehensive sense of the business. You’ll also understand the industry
        better overall, what to expect from your new job, and how to respond
        when you inevitably have to put out fires later.
      </p>
      <p>Next, let's look at each of those items in more detail.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-1" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
        Do Your Due <span class="emphasis">Diligence</span>
      </h2>

      <p>
        If you aren’t confident it’s a good business decision, then don’t buy
        the business yet. That should go without saying, but it's worth
        stressing anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buying a business can be exhilarating, especially when you believe in
        what you're about to buy. But don't let that blind you from
        understanding what you're getting into.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes a business can look healthy and exciting on the outside but be
        different under the hood. Check on total gross revenue, and compare it
        against liabilities, expenses, and profitability. It’s okay if the
        business you’re buying isn’t profitable because you can fix that. It’s
        not good if it’s slowly sinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any serious seller will, at a certain pointin the process, understand
        they need to disclose that information. They may be protective
        initially, but don't be afraid to ask thorough questions. If they won't
        give you specifics, that can be a red flag in its own right.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it’s customer-facing, talk to its customers. Learn what people think
        of the business, what they like and dislike, and how it’s positioned in
        its market.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do some digging online to look up its status&mdash;the secretary of
        state website will tell you if a business is in good standing and, if
        not, what’s wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google the business and its owners to see if they've been involved in
        any scandals or have a bad reputation.
      </p>
      <p>
        You want to know what you’re getting into before you even sit down to
        negotiate. Worst case you walk away after learning something bad and
        save yourself a headache. Best case you can come to the table prepared
        to address your concerns and negotiate.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-2" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
        Learn the <span class="emphasis">Day-to-Day</span> Operations
      </h2>

      <p>
        You don’t want to be learning about how to run the business as you
        already need to be good at it. Especially if the business has existing
        momentum (likely a part of why you want to buy it).
      </p>
      <p>
        In my case, it was a physical retail business I’d been running for
        years, so I knew it inside and out. If that’s not the case for you, then
        this step becomes extra important.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding how the business operates will help you understand what
        you’re going to need to handle once you take it over. If you’re planning
        to hire someone to run it instead, it’ll help inform your hiring
        choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have access to its employees and management, that’s great! Ask
        them some questions about their work life and responsibilities. If you
        don’t, try talking to the existing owners to understand what tasks they
        give their staff (or don't) and why.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might change some of these operations later, but it’s unwise to make
        changes to operations you don’t understand. That’s doubly true if it
        changes things for employees–staff gets nervous when ownership changes
        because you as a newcomer are an unknown quantity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your new team will trust you and support you better if they know you’re
        not going to start ripping things out and changing their lives from the
        second you arrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if the business has no employees and the owner is
        doing all the work, then take time to learn what that work is, how the
        owner has been handling it, and what the challenges are.
      </p>
      <p>
        If they spend 10 hours a day handling support requests and sending
        emails, that's good to know up front. Same with if they've abstracted
        away part of the company to an online service, and doubly so if that
        service is slow or, frankly, bad.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-3" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
        Research the <span class="emphasis">Industry</span>
      </h2>

      <p>
        If you don’t know the industry, you’ll be flying blind. Learn what makes
        the industry tick, what problems often arise, and how they can best be
        resolved/pre-empted.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our case, this was easy because we were already running the business
        before we bought it. We knew which vendors were most likely to ship
        late, which ones were hardest to deal with, and how other companies in
        the industry operate.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you already work in the same industry, you can mostly shortcut this
        one. If you’re an outsider, make the effort to learn more about the
        pillars of the industry you’ll be walking into and what the expectations
        are based on that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't hesitate to reach out to vendors, potential partners, and other
        businesses in the space to see what it's like. As long as the industry
        isn't super cutthroat, people will usually entertain your questions as
        long as you're polite and respect their time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-4" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
        Know the <span class="emphasis">Competitive</span> Landscape
      </h2>

      <p>
        You need to know what the business is up against, where it has to
        compete, and the effects of that competition on the business’ health.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re buying a physical retail business, make sure there isn’t a
        cutthroat competitor just down the street. Or, at least, make sure you
        can beat them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re buying a SaaS company or some other kind of tech, do a
        competitive analysis of the other services on the market that overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if the company isn’t facing competition now, things change. Arming
        yourself with an understanding of the ecosystem will help you pilot your
        new business to success, now and in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        (You can also use competitors as a way to affect the sale. If you know
        the existing owners are up against fierce competition, they’re likely
        more eager to exit, which gives you more opportunity to negotiate if
        you're up for the challenge.)
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-5" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
        Recognize its <span class="emphasis">Dependencies</span>
      </h2>

      <p>
        If possible, try to understand how the business works under the hood. If
        you’re early in negotiations or the buyer isn’t certain they’ll sell,
        you likely won’t have access to most of those details.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as the deal gets closer to completion and contracts are being
        drafted up, ask the departing owner if you can see more of what powers
        the business, from its key employees to software they can’t live
        without. You might not need all of it going forward, but it doesn’t hurt
        to know how it’s working as-is and what the current owner depends on to
        get the job done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be especially on the lookout for core components, whether that's a tech
        stack, a particular vendor, or even a basic service.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our case, we absolutely need a lease (physical location), point of
        sale (software), and wholesale accounts (supply). You’ll be better off
        if you understand this from the start, and can position yourself to
        avoid any interruptions with your basic necessities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-6" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
        Compile a Transition <span class="emphasis">Checklist</span>
      </h2>

      <p>Having a list of known tasks is a huge help.</p>
      <p>
        When the sale is done, you'll already know where to start. You'll have
        prioritized necessary tasks by importance, and will be ready to hit the
        ground running. Plus, you get to high five your past self.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more time you spend organizing tasks and planning now, the less time
        it'll take to start running and growing the business later. That means
        less stress, fewer sleepless nights, and getting to overall be a happier
        business owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prime candidates for this list include where to file forms announcing
        the change of ownership with the IRS, federal government, state, and
        city/county if applicable. You can also prepare in advance the exact
        forms you'll need to submit and how to submit them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've already researched the business' dependencies because some
        super cool stranger on the internet suggested it (no relation), you know
        to update those next. Tackle the most important things first, like the
        government and core needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Worth noting, you'll probably need to open new bank accounts and the
        previous owner will need to close the existing ones. Make sure you have
        a plan in place to smooth out that transition because otherwise it will
        really, really suck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make friends at your local banks and credit unions, and shop around
        ahead of time. We didn't, because we thought the existing bank would
        help transfer everything over, and it was easily the most mind-numbing
        and frustrating part of my last few months.
      </p>
      <p>
        With new accounts and the core needs met, you can move into
        transitioning, or removing, subscriptions and other tools that may have
        come with the business.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="subsection-7" itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
        Starting The <span class="emphasis">Marathon</span>
      </h2>

      <p>
        Let me be totally, ridiculously transparent here: transitioning a
        business to new owners is hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fun part of owning a business is getting to take care of it, help it
        grow, and work on the core tasks that make it tick. The transition
        process is absolutely none of those things and you also can’t shortcut
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it’ll likely be smooth sailing after a while, the weeks following
        an ownership transition are often rocky for everyone involved. Mostly
        that’s because, unlike founding a new company, taking over an existing
        company means you have to handle all of the paperwork and account
        creation while the business continues to run, and ideally without
        interrupting it.
      </p>
      <p>
        That means juggling all the normal tasks to run the business with filing
        forms, emailing company reps, and spending a totally ungodly amount of
        time on the phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        By following these 6 steps, though, you'll have a framework you can
        follow towards success, and will know most of what comes next. I say
        most because, inevitably, things will come up you couldn’t have possibly
        expected. That’s where you’ll have to think on your feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Save your energy for that. Plan ahead so that when shit hits the fan,
        you’re prepared.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a new owner, you owe it to the company not to get burnt out. When you
        burn out, you can't come through as well. So take it in small,
        methodical steps where possible, and conserve energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've went through it myself. I sprinted through 2023 to get to this
        point, and suffered from burnout this year as a result. You can read
        more about my preparation to purchase the business in my

        and make room for activities that recharge you. Take it as a marathon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chip off pieces of your checklists when you can, and prioritize getting
        the most important services and forms filed away first and you’ll be
        just fine. You’ve got this!
