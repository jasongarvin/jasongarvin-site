This year was hard. Really hard. I wrote a different version of this post originally, but it came off too shallow. I wrote of numbers, of data and statistics, but the human version of my story throughout 2023 was conspicuously missing.

Consider this to be that human version. Though I’ll include some data, the numbers only tell part of the tale. Instead, I want to focus on what I achieved this year, and what I learned that I can take forward into the new year.

My year was about perseverance and the value of making small, incremental improvements over time. It was also about exploring my purpose, my “life’s work,” so to speak, and how the trials I endured this year led me closer than ever to finding it.

Though this is a review of my own personal experience this year, I hope you'll find some helpful tidbits you can apply to your own life!

## Setting Intentions

As 2023 began, I wasn’t in a great mental space. I was in an unhealthy spot in my relationship, was beginning to think I’d never get to own the business I’d poured myself into for six years, and had a complete and staggering lack of purpose.

Faced with a future of uncertainty, one where I wasn’t sure if I’d continue to have my partner, my house, or even my job, I had to start figuring things out. I knew I could stay at my job, but I didn’t know if it was the right choice.

The same went for my relationship, and other lingering elements of my life I hadn’t come to terms with yet, but desperately needed to face.

I started by trying to find my purpose.

The truth is, I had no idea how to face those decisions at the time, let alone how to make the right choices. I didn’t know where I was trying to go. I would get so stuck each time, paralyzed by the fear of what could go wrong, that I’d forget to look at the potential upside.

So, when I was setting goals for the year, that’s exactly what my focus was: I wanted to figure out my purpose, and who I wanted to become.

I’m turning 30 next year, which I'm honestly kind of excited about, but it got me thinking nonetheless.

I knew that I loved being a dad, and that supporting our family was important to me. He was the light of my life, in addition of course to his mom and our cat. Really, I think becoming a dad irrevocably changed my life.

See, before I became a dad I didn’t have much direction or care. I was depressed and kind of drifting, even when I liked my life and the things in it. I didn’t think much of the future and kept kicking the can down the road about where I was going and what my purpose would be.

When I became a dad, it made me consider the future in a new way. I wasn’t just looking out for myself anymore; people depended on me. That ended up being a really healthy thing for me.

So for 2023, I figured I should get it all sorted out. I was watching my son start to find his opinions—his preferences—and live according to his own interests, and it inspired me.

I still wanted to own Total Escape Games, but after waiting for years to become an owner as we hit roadblock after roadblock, I’d begun to realize it might not happen and that I needed to start considering alternatives. I'd been preparing to move into the tech industry already since 2020, and decided to lean further into that.

So I started learning web development to support the Fill and Fire team better and assume more responsibility. I’d been learning Python already but was struggling to find practical applications for it besides data science and ML, which wasn’t so much my interest. Web development was full of applications—the ability to create a website on my own was exciting.

For the year, I set a single rule. “Figure out where I’m going in life,” I told myself. This was the year of decisions. I was going to start building momentum and roll myself out of the rut I’d worn in over the years of struggling against outside influences.

## Embarking on a Journey

Finding my purpose was no easy task. I tried (and consumed) a great deal of ideas, read an enormous amount of content, and packed my days unreasonably busy in hopes that the things I valued would stick out.

I only started taking notes on every article and video I consumed late into the year to begin building my knowledge base (great advice I got from reading [Anne-Laure Le Cunff’s articles](https://nesslabs.com/)), but even with it starting in October I have notes for over 75 sources.

To figure out my personal life, and the tasks I value, I settled on trying to draw more, write more, read more, study (and code) every day, find a stretching routine that actually worked, and spend lots of time in meditation. I wasn’t sure if all of it would stick, but I figured trying each thing for a few weeks would quickly tell me if I enjoyed it and was willing to make time for it.

I added one activity at a time, giving it room to become a part of my routine (or fall off the planet) before adding the next task. As of writing this, I’m up to 8 activities I do every day and 2-3 more I do a few times a week.

### A Different Approach to Productivity

Next time, rather than do a little bit of a lot of things each day, I’m going to try spending a couple of weeks dedicated each individual activity.

I’ll be curious to see if it’s more effective to make incremental improvements across a broad number of skills, or to dive deep into one skill at a time and stay in a particular area of study for longer.

---

By building good (and healthy) routines, I started to feel better. I paired the above goals with eating healthier, quitting energy drinks, and sleeping more, which helped enormously in having the energy and ability to, you know, actually follow through on that huge list of activities I set for myself.

Over the year I paid attention to which activities invigorated me versus the ones that felt stressful, hard, or unpleasant. It was okay for an activity to feel hard or stressful (coding gets that way sometimes for sure, and don’t even get me started on learning to draw), but something that felt unpleasant was a big warning sign.

Once I’d really gotten underway trying new things and adding to my routine, I felt more productive and confident. I was learning a lot and was getting to see myself improve in small increments each week.

I strongly believe setting that foundation helped me to make the grueling decisions ahead of me for the rest of the year.

Choosing to leave my relationship and break apart the family was an immensely difficult decision, and I'll leave it at that. But it was a decision I had to commit to, one way or the other, and it feels good to at least know I've made it to the other side.

In the end, I realized it was time to move on. It was the hardest decision I’ve ever made, and maybe ever will make. I think I'll always be grateful we resolved things peacefully, and that I still get to visit regularly, see my son (and cat), and even spend fun, happy times with my ex-partner.

I don’t think navigating the end of our relationship is a transferable skill, nor would I like to repeat the process of separating. But in the end, it did push me to figure out what I truly valued in life and carve out time/effort for those things, and it especially forced me to be willing to make other difficult decisions in my life because, by comparison, they were easy.

## Recapping the Year

In the end, I (mostly) came through! I have a stronger sense of purpose, and have begun to notice which parts of my life make me happy and which ones make me crazy.

In particular, I did a great job cultivating new habits. I followed my own advice from [my first-ever blog post about building habits](/blog/posts/harnessing-the-power-of-habits) and finished the year feeling confident in my new routine(s).

Throughout the year, I:

- Meditated every day
- Stretched every day except Sundays (I take one day off each week)
- Read something on 330 days
- Drew or designed something on 334 days
- Wrote/edited code on 342 days

I discovered a new love for web development. I was infatuated with the tech industry overall and had been loving the challenges we’d been working to overcome with Fill and Fire. But that was UX and Product Design. Getting to actually code and implement the interfaces, the designs, the animations, and the user experience improvements myself was mesmerizing.

I spent a lot of time exploring my drawing habits. What I discovered is I don’t like feeling like I have to draw for some kind of deadline, but that having specific prompts helps force me to improve. Participating in [Inktober](https://inktober.com/) was an amazing exercise, and while it was pretty stressful, I loved the results of what I was able to create.

Finally making the time to read books was amazing. I love it a lot. Like way more than I like reading articles, and especially more than I like reading newsletters. The latter is because I realized after subscribing to tons of different ones all year that I dislike newsletters on average.

I found a couple of great newsletters which I still read daily. [The Maker Mind Newsletter](https://nesslabs.com/newsletter) from Anne-Laure Le Cunff is an excellent resource for getting to know ourselves better and setting our lives up for success. [Every](https://every.to/) is a beautifully crafted daily newsletter that never fails to surprise and delight me (not to mention teach me new ideas).

But I probably cut 10-12 others from my routine throughout the year. The pressure of having an inbox full of reading every morning was awful, stressful, and bad. I started each day feeling behind. So that got cut pretty quickly.

Ignoring digital content, I also read 8 full books this year. I thoroughly enjoyed 6 of them (including [Star Trek: The Classic Episodes](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/30066684)), felt okay about one, and hated another. I learned that I enjoy nonfiction in moderation, but that not all nonfiction writing is equal, and I have no patience for books packed with filler.

Finally, after many years, I managed to get into the groove with daily meditations and stretching, and am happy to say I can comfortably touch my toes for the first time since I was in high school and actively involved in martial arts.

### Managing Time is Important

In hindsight, a lot of 2023 was about getting the most out of my time. It's a topic I later wrote about in a blog post about navigating time as a business owner, which synthesizes a lot of what I learned even before I'd taken over the business.

## Finding Purpose

It turns out, there’s more to me than being a dad. It also turns out that being a dad is really damn important to me. Go figure.

My son is still my number one priority, and I'm excited to watch him continue to grow, learn, and develop as a person. His happiness is infinitely linked to my own, and even in the most challenging of times, having him in my life helps push me forward and encourages me to be the best version of myself.

It's been hard balancing my ambitions against being in his life often enough for him to feel secure, but it's a balancing act I must learn to master. Though I've discovered a strong passion for business and entrepreneurship this year, I refuse to be an absentee parent, and am keeping that top-of-mind as I continue to progress in my career.

At the same time, as this post is published, I am officially one of three owners of Total Escape Games, joined by two long-time business partners and dear friends of mine! It feels like a new chapter of my life has just begun, like this is a moment I’ll remember deep into my later years.

You can learn more about [what I learned throughout the process of buying a business](/blog/posts/buying-a-business) in a more recent post of mine.

I feel a great sense of purpose and accomplishment in the work I’ve done for the store, both in building a great experience for customers and in learning to become a good, ethical manager who takes care of his team. Getting to finally own the business is a huge breath of fresh air, and has revitalized my excitement to keep running the store.

With that in mind, another piece of my purpose-puzzle is building community and creating great experiences. I deeply enjoy achieving big goals through my business prowess and growing industry knowledge.

I reconnected with my Psychology degree throughout this year, finding new parallels between what I learned in school and UX, business leadership, marketing, and effective website design.

Tying all those pieces together helped me realize I do love Psychology, just not in the clinical sense. I value practical Psychology, easily applied to life’s problems and goals, rather than the overly cerebral conceptual Psychology of higher education.

By combining all of the different disciplines I explored this year, I came out of the crucible with a new understanding of how all my seemingly-divergent interests interweave. This funneled into a single idea: experience.

What I truly value, and what gets me more excited than anything else, is creating things that elicit a certain reaction from others. This applies to building websites, designing good UX, revising procedures and workflows, and writing.

Really, as long as I can create things, and those things make other people feel, I’m happy.

## Looking Ahead

For 2024, I want to focus on community outreach, business growth, and creativity.

Since I’m officially an owner of Total Escape Games, it feels appropriate to spend the year focusing on business growth. I want to see TEG modernize, both in branding (it’s 15 years old and due for a facelift) and in operations. I think we’re already in a good spot, but I want to become truly excellent.

By focusing on business, I’m starting to build my life’s work.

Outside of work, I want to connect with the local small business community in Broomfield, Colorado. I want to join the local chamber of commerce, spend more time partnering up with business owners in the area, and help grow the community with my expertise.

I’m also excited to learn from the incredible business owners in the area.

By engaging with the community, getting to know other professionals in the area, and providing valuable services to the people around me, I can also contribute to my budding life’s work.

Finally, I want to expand my creative outlets. I’m already working to become proficient at using Adobe Illustrator, and have been using InDesign a lot more, which means I get to create more graphics and design elements for work and my other projects. I also want to create some cool personal pieces of art, and have already queued up a 30-day drawing exercise for next year.

## Drawing Conclusions

At the beginning of 2023, I thought the world was more black and white. I felt like things were either good or bad, and decisions were either right or wrong. I agonized over making the “right” decisions and choosing the “good” things.

What I’ve realized, however, is that often things exist more on a spectrum than a binary scale. Decisions tend to be neither right nor wrong, and either choice has consequences.

Being able to realize this truth has helped me get unstuck and start moving forward again. I made some difficult choices this year, and those decisions freed me up to explore my future.

That freedom helped me make incremental changes to my life, explore my own history and mind, and find a deep passion for the human experience. I’ve begun to walk the path ahead of me towards my life’s work.

If I had to leave you with one takeaway from this year, one piece of advice if you’re experiencing any of the struggles I’ve felt, it’s this: just make a decision.

The agony leading up to the decision is usually far worse than the consequences and clean-up of the decision itself. And you can’t move forward, and find what you love in life, if you’re not willing to make hard choices.

So start making decisions. Try a new food. Explore a new hobby. Visit a new place. Then, if you love it, lean in. If you don’t, make the decision to stop.

Just, whatever you do, try to make the choice yourself. Because if you don’t, I've discovered the people and circumstances around you tend to eventually make them for you.

Remember: life is what you make of it, and it’s your story to tell.

Happy New Year, and may we all find success in 2024!
