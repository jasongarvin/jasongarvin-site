As I’ve gotten into the flow of owning my business, I’ve realized how careful I need to be with my time. My days disappear into the wind so easily it’s scary.

Gone are the days of saying yes to every meeting that crosses my desk. Now I weigh opportunities based on time commitment and potential value. It’s wild to me how differently I approach scheduling today—there are so many people and things that want my time now.

Before owning a business, I felt good about my time blocking skills. I’d been using a planner for years and have [Trello boards](https://trello.com/) for every occasion. There’s a reason I lead our operations.

When I [reviewed my year at the end of 2023](/blog/posts/2023-in-review), I thought I was pretty good at time management. I am, don't get me wrong, but wow is it a lot harder owning a business.

Navigating the crunch of this new life while stubbornly holding onto my hobbies and social life has taught me hard lessons about managing my time and what I can accomplish in a day.

For those of you who are just as greedy, who don’t want to let go of everything else in chasing a single goal, who want better control of your life: there are ways of making your time work better for you.

Learn from the battle I've been waging for the past few months.

It's tough , but if you can get clear on your priorities then you have a chance. Be deliberate in your schedule and in prioritizing your personal needs and you'll be better protected from the urge to overwork.

## Designing Your Ideal Life

Before you can start to block time in your calendar, you owe it to yourself to figure out why you want that time in the first place.

For me, I block time so I can see friends, go for long walks to clear my head, doodle, or read. I block time for my hobbies and loved ones, and for my favorite activities.

I do it because they matter to me. Having time with my loved ones brings me joy and makes my life better. It also gives me the chance to indulge in great conversations which inspire me when I get back to work. Making time for my hobbies recharges me and lets me see the world from different angles than usual.

In order to maintain those hobbies, I deliberately [learned to build habits](/blog/posts/harnessing-the-power-of-habits) around them to make them semi-permanent parts of my life.

If I were to strip those from my routine, I would be less as a person. Less happy. Less fulfilled. Less creative. And those are key pieces of myself I want to encourage.

So when I consider my calendar, I make sure I have time for those people and hobbies because they fuel me.

Your challenge is to figure out the same things for yourself. What brings you joy? What activities inspire you? What helps you clear your head and get creative about ideas that improve your business?

When you’re not inspired, your professional life suffers. Same with when you’re drained, depressed, burnt out, or just plain bored.

Feeling any of those ways is a sign your routine isn’t working for you.

Take five minutes. Write down a list of activities and people you enjoy. There’s no limit to how many things you write down—whatever comes to mind is perfect. Then repeat this exercise with things that feel like they make your life much worse.

Once you have those lists, read them so you remember what you wrote.

## The Challenge of Finding Balance

It’s cliche, but living a good life is really the goal.

To pursue a good life, first narrow down the list you’ve just written into your absolute favorite things. The ones you can’t or don’t want to live without. These will be your highest priorities.

Next, narrow down your list of dislikes to the worst, most miserable parts of your life. We're talking draining activities on the level of spending a day stuck in customs or at the DMV. We're talking 10-hour layover levels of misery.

As you go through your calendar, notice how often these each show up. How often are you doing something you absolutely despise? And, how often do you make time for what you love?

Chances are that balance is uneven in favor of the worse and tedious tasks.

Business ownership means doing a lot of tasks and taking on a lot of responsibilities that are essential but also kind of miserable. Some of this can’t be avoided. That’s okay.

But notice what can. If you have a lot of phone calls you don’t need, cut them. Turn them into emails. Get used to refusing those calls, or deflecting them to other forms of communication that work better for you. If you have an assistant, or employees, teach them to screen your calls.

Do the same for meetings, obligations, and tasks that plain suck. You don’t have time for that. You want to be building a great business and spending time with great people. You want to be living.

Life is too short to spend all your time on monotony. And life is full of monotonous tasks that love to eat up your day.

When you start trimming down those tasks, you’ll notice gaps in your schedule. Use those to add more of what you love. Plan coffee with a friend. Take a loved one out for dinner. Go for a walk. Read a book you’ve been putting off. Flirt. Socialize. Have fun.

## Minimize Your Obligations

You’ve got to learn to say no to what fills your schedule before you find the room for everything you want to be doing instead.

Sales people want your time. Your employees want your guidance. Your customers, assuming you have them, want your attention.

Your modern lifestyle will do everything it can to pack your day with nonsense. Traffic will eat away at you. Social media will rob your evenings. Entertainment will level you out and make you feel like you did something even when you didn’t.

You have to learn to say no.

Now, some of those things are important. You can’t avoid it all. Your employees, in most cases, actually do need and deserve guidance. Sometimes you’ll want to hear a sales pitch because it’s relevant. Entertainment is healthy in moderation.

The key is to cut out everything else. If it’s not making you happy, and it’s not helping to move your life forward, it has to go.

Move closer to work and reduce your commute if you can. Learn to put your phone down, or install an app that will block you from your 300th X (Twitter) thread at a certain time of day so you can focus on what you wanted to do instead.

It’s hard. Our lives are full of things battling for our attention, and many of them are really, really good at winning that fight. Even worse, they’re endless time sinks.

It sounds tough, but be relentless. Give your lifestyle, and your time, the same intensity you put towards your business.

## You've Got to Make a Change

Sometimes it’s time to unplug.

Hopefully by this point you’re getting the idea. Even better if you already know a few areas of your life that can get trimmed down or cut entirely.

Your life is yours for the taking. That’s the moral here. In a world where time is fleeting, where there’s always another obligation, you have to fight for yourself. You have to safeguard your time intensely and without fail.

If you want to learn to play the piano, block time for it. Put it in your calendar. 30 minutes, piano, every night. Twice a week. Whatever fits and gives you the time and flexibility to focus on that hobby.

Want to go out? Go out. But don’t just think about it. Put that into your calendar, and refuse to schedule anything else during that time. From 7-11p every Friday night, you will be unbothered by work to instead cut loose on the dance floor with your friends.

The magic of this approach is, once you’re used to it, you’ll feel much more recharged and ready to run your business. It's easier to make hard choices when you're feeling fresh instead of worn out.

Recharging with hobbies, with good company, is an amazing remedy to burnout.

You owe it to yourself and your business to protect yourself from burnout. It will wreak havoc on your professional life. It could make your business fail. When you’re burnt out, you can’t come through for your peers, your employees, your business, or yourself.

Next time you see an hour-long meeting and think to yourself, “hey, maybe that could be an email,” I hope you remember this article.

Most of all, I hope you get some much-needed time to yourself.
