AI has been a major part of our lives for over a year, ever since the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI. The explosion of AI-related tools and products, not to mention wild claims of future utopias (or death by robot) are abundant in all forms of media today.

So, how are you feeling about it so far?

As a forward-thinking tech enthusiast, a creative, and a business owner, I’ve thought about AI a lot. I’ve seen countless AI products encroach in my skill space. Chances are you’ve felt this pressure too—the power AI exerts over us when we consider our future.

To better understand that future, I spent the past few months relentlessly digging into AI to learn everything I could. I explored how it works, built and trained models, played around in every sandbox I found, and used several AI-powered apps.

What I’ve discovered is that AI probably won’t be apocalyptic, and neither will it save us. It’s more likely for AI to lead the charge into the next evolution of technology and modern tools, and change how we connect with the world as a result.

It’ll be a source of economic growth within capitalism. If we’re lucky, it’ll empower everyday people to explore ideas and skills we didn’t know we had, too.

## Clarifying AI's Existence

AI is a fascinating tool. It’s amazing at analyzing data, at brainstorming, and at supporting human thought. It also makes a surprisingly good companion in some cases, and can provide mentorship and insight at an incredible pace.

On the other hand, AI is not human. It’s not a conscious entity with its own needs. It’s a tool created by tech companies as another means of innovation. It’s a product. A way to create new markets and provide utility to the public at a cost.

This makes AI fascinating, but it also makes it dangerous to us as consumers. We need to remember that AI is similar to the wave of SaaS apps that came before it. We need to remember that AI is a technology being created by businesses in the interest of profit and growth, not a benevolent (or malicious) force with a mind of its own.

So when we look at AI and its effect on the world, let’s consider it from that perspective. Set aside the Hollywood ideals of AI and its possible sentience. Set aside the doomsday and utopian scenarios.

AI solves a great many problems, creates others, and acts as a bridge between many professional and creative pursuits.

It threatens to change the definition of work and creativity.

It promises to change what it means to be human, and how we connect with the technology around us. But even still, it’s a tool. An innovation. So let’s consider it as such.

## Business Goals and AI

If there were ever a product designed to make businesses excited, it’s AI. It makes operations more efficient. It’s cost-effective as hell. It’s new, it’s shiny, and it promises to shrink your overhead while improving productivity. What’s not to like?

When I see marketing for AI tools, it tends to be the same. “10x your productivity,” they say. “Automate key segments of [this work] to save yourself and your team time.”

It’s hyperbolic statements about how AI will single-handedly make your business a success and give you free time back so you can go party on the beach. It’s a solopreneur’s dream: convenient help with tedious tasks without the burden of payroll.

In contrast, how many tools are coming out claiming to leverage AI that actually improve the work we do? A lot of it feels like vaporware. A lot of it is vaporware. But there are some incredible outliers.

ChatGPT, and other large language models (LLMs), are changing people’s lives. Writing a report, doing research, drafting up a presentation, and other tedious tasks have never been easier or more accessible.

It’s not a silver bullet. LLMs hallucinate. But it’s an amazing improvement for anyone who needs to brainstorm work, generate drafts, test ideas, or do quick research into a subject.

LLMs solve a real need.

It’s the same with [Notion’s AI summarization feature](https://www.notion.so/product/ai) when I’m otherwise stuck in a maze of notes I’ve left myself trying to find a small piece of information.

AI has an incredible ability to summarize data.

So when we look at AI’s role in business, it’s easy to see where it shines. We can process loads more data, which leads to better insights and quicker decision-making when implementing features and pivoting sales objectives.

This is how AI is marketed, and the major source of why companies are receiving funding. VC firms want to support AI endeavors as the tool of the future. CEOs and business leaders want AI to streamline their business and make their payroll leaner.

AI is a great tool to empower decision-makers in business. It’s a huge boon, and it has a lot of really interesting applications that undoubtedly make business more efficient. But, those same applications only have dubious success in making life fulfilling.

This is a limitation of AI. It makes us more productive and supports decision-making, but do businesses really need to be more efficient at this? Is maximum efficiency using AI even worth it?

Is chasing the legendary $1b valuation worth anything besides bragging rights?

The truth is, to me, business doesn’t make us happy. Business is a means to an end. At its best, it’s a fulfilling career and a great point of pride, but it’s not inherently a part of what we need as people to exist and thrive.

Business isn’t why we’re alive. I’m saying that as a business owner. I know. It goes against what we hear in our peer groups, and what we’re sold by presentations and marketing copy, but it’s true.

## AI for the People

When it comes to the fulfillment of ourselves as people, it’s more complicated.

For some of us, a good life may be a comfortable one. In this case, AI makes sense as the next step in human societal evolution. It does work for us, after all, and it abstracts away all that unpleasant stuff to get you back to reclining in the sun.

On the other hand, it makes me think of Wall-E. Not in an endearing, “look at the little robot trying his best,” kind of way, either. It makes me nervous for our future. I don’t want to be a guy in a chair drifting around. It’s not what makes life worthwhile.

If you’ve read anything from me in the past, you already know how important community, and human connection, is to me.

AI threatens this, I think. AI makes it easier not to talk to people, going so far as to actively make it harder to reach another human. For example, service interactions are getting automated at an alarming rate. And as the surface area of human-to-human interaction shrinks, we get lonelier.

AI makes it easier for businesses to downsize departments, and reduce the amount of professionals they pay. It makes it easier to automate art, music, and video generation. It removes entire fields of creative work at the lowest level.

High-earning and well-respected artists will be fine. When you have a following, people seek you out because it’s you. But as a newer artist, or someone trying to learn a creative field in 2024, AI is scary.

But AI has some really interesting applications, too. AI therapy is fascinating to me, and so is the idea of having an AI companion. It’s intimidating as a simulation of human life and as a replacement for human comforts, but there's real appeal for these options especially in extreme cases of isolation.

Even in interpersonal life, or exercises like journaling, AI’s ability to process data gives us the opportunity to examine ourselves like never before.

AI gives me insight into myself, my patterns, and the patterns of what’s around me in a way I could never do on my own. No amount of pen-and-paper journaling will give me the insights that AI can pull out of a long block of my own writing.

It’s a mixed bag, and it comes down to individual preferences. I have colleagues who are deep into AI, and are seeing huge gains in their personal lives because of it. I have other colleagues who are dealing with deep depression, have had their art stolen, or are profoundly struggling to adjust to an uncertain future.

Neither side is easy. Adopting new technology is tough even at the best of times. But what I come back to every time is the idea of our future, and whether AI truly helps us arrive at the finish line we’re creating for ourselves.

## Evaluating the Impact of AI

It’s hard to say this early how AI will affect us. But some trends are becoming clear.

There’s been a lot of talk recently about the “loneliness epidemic.” I’ve seen it happening around me. It’s easier than ever to feel isolated, to be unsure how to meet people. AI makes that worse.

Ai makes analyzing huge swaths of personal data using much easier, which is worrying in the hands of large companies. It makes data analysis all but a solved field, and gives power to those with enough data for AI to make strong judgments.

These uses for AI lean into existing issues we've already been seeing. [I recently wrote about my dislike for SEO](/blog/posts/seo-versus-humans), which is made worse by LLMs' ability to generate SEO-friendly content, lower the barrier to creating adequate content, and flood the market with mediocre writing.

Alternatively, AI risks usurping SEO entirely by making search into an answer engine instead. [Google announced the launch of AI-generated search results](https://torchbox.com/blog/what-do-google-ai-overviews-mean-for-seo/) at I/O 2024, creating a lot of concern about the future of SEO and web searches in general.

Machine learning and its use in algorithms is also guilty of making social media problematically addictive. It gets us better stuck in the endless loop of scrolling by powering better-tuned algorithms.

AI consolidates power and perpetuates unhealthy cycles online.

On the other hand, it gives people opportunities. Being able to practice for an interview with a pretend interviewer is amazing. Getting to brainstorm with ChatGPT is inspiring. There are a great many applications for AI that do genuinely make our lives better, or at least easier.

It’s not a simple problem. We have to understand it better as individuals and as a society to decide its worth to us.

## Will AI be Good or Bad?

I wish I could pass a simple judgment. I wish it was that simple—that I could wrap up this post with an optimistic take, pat you on the back, and usher you out the door.

In reality, however, AI is anything but simple. It is a far-reaching technology that promises to affect every aspect of our lives, from calling into support to researching ideas to even the work we do each day.

In the end, I think AI will be both good and bad.

AI will do bad things when given to bad people, and lead to changes that hurt the rest of us. It will empower businesses to be ruthless, to clear out entire teams in favor of lean efficiency. It will automate the hiring process, separate us from our peers, and let algorithms decide whole parts of our lives.

But it will also create innovation, expand science, and allow us to invent things that used to be pure fantasy. It will give us the chance to learn and grow in ways we couldn’t before—it will give us resources we didn't have, and support we haven't before felt.

In the end, it’s up to us to decide whether that’s worth it. Whether the good outweighs the bad. It’s our jobs as individual contributors, business leaders, and artists, to police AI and the companies producing it. It's our responsibility as people of this age.

Knowing our boundaries as a society will be huge in shaping how this technology changes the world. Now more than ever we must consider the future.
