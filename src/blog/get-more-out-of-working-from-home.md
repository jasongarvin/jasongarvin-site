After 7 years running the store in person, I recently switched to spending most of my week working from home. This has been a huge change for me, and has come with some amazing benefits but also some unexpected costs.

When I work in the store, it helps me feel connected. I spend more time with our employees and get to know them, and the same goes for customers. I’m more socially involved, and have a better sense of what our customers and staff are feeling overall.

On the other hand, I can’t get much done. Being so plugged into the day-to-day conversations means it takes me way longer to complete projects and work on the business, which isn’t great.

To try achieving the best of both worlds, I now split my time each week with 2 days in the store and 3 from home.

That means I get to spend my in-store time focused on our customers, having conversations, and keeping up to date on how the store is running, while still having enough focus time to make progress on growing the business and adding new features.

As I’ve been getting used to this new routine, I noticed a few tricky trends:

- Work and life can get blurry when you work from home
- It’s easier to get distracted at home
- It’s more isolating being at home so much
- I’m getting way more done overall

I’ve been working on ways around the costs of working from home, all the while trying to maximize the gains I’ve gotten from it. Here are the results of my own experiment.

## Draw a Line Between Work and Play

Keep work to one place in the house whenever possible.

When I work from home, I don’t work on the couch, or in bed, or at the kitchen table. I work at my desk. In fact, when I’m at home, work stays at my desk.

Because having the same space for work and leisure can blur the boundaries between when you should be working, and doesn’t provide the cutoff point that commuting gives to your day, it’s extra important to create that separation yourself.

To reinforce the habit, I keep my work stuff at/near my desk so I don’t have to get up for anything. Then, when I’m done with my tasks for the day, I step away. Literally. I actually move to a different part of my house for a while, take a nap, or go out.

That way, there’s still the feeling of an “office,” so when I’m relaxing on the couch watching Netflix later I’m not quite as tempted to go back to work. I can unplug.

It’s not 100%, and that’s okay. I already would work on the business at home before I transitioned to seriously, for real, working from home. But by siloing each part of my life in this small way, I can help manage my home environment and keep space for myself to relax and unwind after a long day.

### Local Coffee Shops as Places of Work

Coffee shops or bookstores are great places to get some work done when you work remotely and want to get out of the house.

I won’t get into it too much since I'm focusing specifically on working from home in this post, but I love bringing my laptop to a local coffee shop to work whenever I feel burnt out, tired, or in need of something new.

## Avoid Distractions

It’s really easy to get distracted at home.

The store is a work context, meaning I expect to be working, talking with customers, and getting things done. My employees are working, too, which keeps me on track. Having that atmosphere around me keeps me focused. Mirroring works.

By comparison, at home it’s so easy to drift away from a given task. All my favorite belongings are around me. My personal computer is right there with all its infinite distractions–social media, games, personal files, art projects.

It’s ridiculously easy to start working on one thing, only to find I’ve drifted off after browsing the internet or getting sidetracked following a rabbit hole.

To remedy this, I don’t work on my personal computer. I use my work computer, instead, that doesn’t have the same distractions installed. If you don’t have a separate device, you can try creating a work profile on your home computer that stays strictly business.

I also cleared away all the distractions from my desk. No more art supplies and sketchbooks. Those are in an art cubby. The desk is for work during work hours, and that’s it. When I can’t reach for a distraction, I stay better focused.

Pay attention to the things around you that end up pulling your focus away from work. Those are the things to be careful around. Whatever your distraction, and you will find one, stay mindful of its effect and take steps to keep it out of your work environment.

### Notifications are Distracting

I traded in-store distractions for notifications. Now that I’m not around as often, I get way more emails, messages, and calls. It’s like a constant barrage. Managing notifications has become a much bigger part of my day as a result.

Right away, I set specific times to check email: first thing in the morning, after lunch, and right before I stop working for the day.

Group chat notifications get checked every couple of hours between chunks of focused work so that I can stay more on-top of the team’s needs, and I only let myself get pulled away if I’m specifically tagged or if someone calls me. Since I do still have to be mindful of the store, I can’t silence notifications altogether, but this at least gives me some time for focused work where I’m typically uninterrupted.

### Meetings Interrupt Flow

Let me start by saying: don’t schedule meetings in the middle of the day if you don’t hate yourself. They’re distracting, and it takes way more time to settle into work afterwards than you may expect.

If you’re like me, then you end up not wanting to start anything big before the meeting, too, in case it runs long. It’s bad on both ends.

Instead, try clustering your meetings into one day if you can. You’ll probably be tired by the end of the day, especially if you tend to be more introverted, but it’s a way better alternative to having your flow constantly interrupted.

If that’s not an option, I’m a fan of afternoon meetings. That way, I have a few hours in the morning for focused work, separated by a lunch break from when I need to switch gears into meetings and preparation.

## Stay in Touch With People

It’s easy when working from home to feel isolated, or at least disconnected from the rest of your team.

While this doesn’t immediately relate to productivity, over time it can drag you down. When you get lonely, or feel depressed, you’re going to be less effective at work. This is one of those ways where prioritizing your mental health can have a huge impact.

I solve this by making it a point to see friends and family more often outside of work. Sometimes I’ll even take my lunch break to catch up with a friend or mentor, and that helps energize me for the second half of the day.

It helps, too, having someone to bounce ideas off. When I get stuck and I’m at the store, I can get suggestions or brainstorm with my business partners and employees. At home, a lot of the time it’s just me. And I’m not a huge fan of talking to myself.

Because of that, I’ve gotten in the habit of calling one of my business partners at least once a week so we can talk strategy and recap last week’s performance.

At its best, this call lets us get onto the same page and plan strategies. At worst, I get to catch up with someone I care about, connect with him, and have a good conversation. It’s a win-win either way, and I often come away from it feeling inspired.

It’s easy to feel isolated working from home, especially if you live alone. Don’t let yourself fall into that routine, and make sure you’re going out sometimes.

## Get Some Serious Work Done

Working from home means the only thing in my way is myself most days.

I spent a whole heap of time detailing how I keep myself from ruining my own productivity and stay focused, so now we can get to the fun part: doing the best work.

At the start of the day, I check my email. A lot of the time it’s spam or quick answers, but sometimes a new email leads to a new project.

With that in mind, I get into setting my todo list for the day. I reference my planner and Trello boards (I have so many), the tasks from my email, and any goals I’ve set the previous week, and fuse all of that into one big todo list.

If it’s too much for a single day, I’ll break it apart and set tasks for the following days ahead of time that I know I need to address.

Other times, I didn’t accomplish everything from the previous day, so I’ll review my week and pull those tasks forward to the current list.

This process, mixed with a healthy dose of coffee, gets my head screwed on straight and ensures I’m ready to get into it.

Then, I use the morning to crank through focused work. As the day goes on, it’s natural to get sleepier and more distracted. That’s why I focus on my most important work first. Then, even if the whole day falls apart afterward, the biggest tasks are out of the way.

Being at home means more flexibility, which is fantastic. It means if I’m exhausted one day I can sleep in a little, or take a short mid-morning nap to fix my energy level before getting back into work. It’s a huge perk. There’s no way I could nap at the store.

It also means I can take breaks when they make the most sense. Instead of taking a break at the same time each day to work around my employees, or being interrupted by a sudden wave of customers, I can take breaks naturally between projects.

Spending 50 minutes designing our website and reaching a good stopping point, for example, grants me 10 minutes of relaxation before the next thing.

It’s amazing how big of a difference this flexibility makes.

Overall, working from home can be fantastic. You avoid the commute, and get to be in a comfortable environment all day wearing what you want and acting how you want.

The flip side is you have to keep yourself more accountable. I thought I was already good at this, and was surprised to find how much more easily distracted and chaotic my routine became when I didn’t have the structure of going into the store.

Pay attention to where you stumble, and take steps to address distraction, and I have no doubt your work from home journey will be a huge success!

I’m still working on my new routine, but I can feel myself cresting the hill. It’s a liberating feeling, and I believe that you’ll find it in your life, too.
