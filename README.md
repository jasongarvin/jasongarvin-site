# Jason Garvin's website

Here is the raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of my static website about my journey, who I am, and how I got where I am now.

I'll be implementing a blog and portfolio shortly, where yo'll be able to view some of the designs I've worked on and read about my experiences in business, software, startups, and user experience design.

Please note that the current version is still an early draft, and there will be many improvements between now and when v1.0 goes fully live.
