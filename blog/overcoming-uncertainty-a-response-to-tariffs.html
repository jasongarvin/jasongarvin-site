      <section itemprop="abstract">
        <p>
          A day hasn’t gone by without someone talking to me about tariffs.
          My industry is panicking. My friends are anxious. Every meeting I
          attend, every conversation I have, includes this nasty little
          six-letter word that I’m only ever half-sure I’m spelling right.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a business owner, I don’t have the luxury of ignoring it or
          waiting to see how it all shakes out. I have to act proactively to
          protect our store, protect our livelihood, and try my damndest to
          predict the future. Our prosperity depends on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s an impossible feat, but I’m trying nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, let’s talk about uncertainty in business and how we can best
          navigate the times when the future is opaque and information is
          lacking.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="subsection-1" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          Make Good (and Careful) Decisions
        </h2>

        <p>
          Yes, this is a boring section name. Yes, this is really what it
          comes down to in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tricky thing about making good decisions is that, normally,
          you want a good foundation of information to inform your choice.
          The more the better. In a world where everything is predictable and
          all quantities are revealed, you can make the best decisions because
          you have access to, in theory,
          <em>all of the known information.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          This slowly unravels the less context and data you have.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of tariffs, we don’t know how long they’re going to last.
          We don’t know which countries will continue to suffer them, and
          which will impose retaliatory ones on us. We don’t know the
          long-term implications of this economic shakeup, and who’s going
          to survive them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, we don’t even know if companies will actually go out of
          business because we don’t know how long this will last.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we do know is the current numbers, what the president has said,
          and how the rest of the world is reacting for now.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I’m writing this, China has tariffs of 145%. It might be
          different by the time you’re reading this. Last week there were
          high tariffs on everyone, now they’re mostly down to 10%. Last week,
          smart phones were exempted. This week, there’s talk of them being
          affected again.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a landscape like that, the future is in constant flux.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what do we do, then? Well, we do our best. We make decisions
          based on the information we do have: internal performance data and
          trends, industry reactions, the stock market, local and
          international news.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the external world is experiencing upheaval, all we can rely
          upon is what we’ve built and surrounded ourselves with.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the store, this means a couple of things:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Stocking up on products at the current cost so we have plenty to
            sell for the next 2-4 months, especially if they’re made in China.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meeting with everyone on the team to explain our strategy moving
            forward, arming everyone with as much knowledge as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            Speaking with distributors, publishers, and anywhere else we
            source goods to understand what they anticipate happening and the
            preparations they’re making.
          </li>
          <li>
            Canceling or delaying plans that involve increased cost
            (new software tools, rewards programs, and most non-essential
            spending).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I want to make one exception very clear about the above list,
          however: we are not cutting staff, wages, hours, or outreach efforts
          within our community. In fact, we just announced a new discount
          teachers can use to bring games into their classrooms and
          after-school clubs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an important factor:
          <em>be careful making changes that lead to semi-permanent or worse outcomes.</em>
          If I fire an employee, I’m not getting them back. If I cut wages,
          I risk losing people I value tremendously. If I stop supporting
          the businesses, schools, and people around us, I’m souring
          relationships right as we need each other the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s important to anticipate consequences, not just gains, when
          making decisions. Especially when you’re flying blind and you don’t
          know how long you’ll have to fly in circles while you wait for the
          tower to give you the clear to land.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="subsection-2" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          Be a Leader and Lead Well
        </h2>

        <p>
          In times of uncertainty, your leadership skills are at their most
          important. Anyone can be a good leader when times are easy, money is
          plentiful, and everything is soaring. It’s much more difficult to be
          a good leader through difficult times.
        </p>
        <p>
          The people working for and with you aren’t dumb. They know some of
          what’s going on, and they may even be well-informed. Hell, they may
          know the current situation better than you, and that's a good thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Treat them like the intelligent people they are. Arm them with as
          much information as you can so they understand the situation.
          Hiding information only makes people scared and erratic. Don’t
          starve your team right as they need your support.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s uncomfortable, but it’s downright essential.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re hosting our first-ever mandatory all-hands meeting
          so we can walk the team through our plans for the
          remainder of the year and how we plan to react depending on what
          happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, though, we’re going to open the floor up to our
          employees to ask questions. Any questions. They don’t even have to
          be about the store. Instead, we want to act as a stabilizing force
          to the people around us who dedicate themselves to the hard work
          we depend on to keep the store growing.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="subsection-3" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          Uncertainty is Exhausting
        </h2>

        <p>
          I’m already tired, and we're only getting started. How about you?
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s talk (briefly) about mental health before I let you go,
          because everything is harder in times of uncertainty. Everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take care of yourself. Get good sleep, and look after your body.
          See friends. Talk with peers and professionals you respect. Go out
          in public and spend time around people. Take a nap. Whatever it
          is you use to decompress and relax, put it to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you burn out, it all comes crashing down. Taking care of yourself
          is so, so important. If you get fatigued, you’re going to become more
          emotional and more reactionary. It’ll take a toll on your decision
          making, and may feed into a vicious cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, don’t do that. Be kind to yourself, give yourself grace, and
          acknowledge that there is no such thing as a perfect decision
          right now. Some of us will make money, some of us will lose money.
          Some of us may even close, though I hope with all my heart
          it doesn’t come to that.
        </p>
        <p>
          And, be kind to each other out there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take care. We’ll get through this.
