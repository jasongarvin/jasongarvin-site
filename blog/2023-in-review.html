          This year was hard. Really hard. I wrote a different version
          of this post originally, but it came off too shallow. I wrote of
          numbers, of data and statistics, but the human version of my story
          throughout 2023 was conspicuously missing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider this to be that human version. Though I’ll include some data,
          the numbers only tell part of the tale. Instead, I want to focus on what
          I achieved this year, and what I learned that I can take forward into
          the new year.
        </p>
        <p>
          My year was about perseverance and the value of making small,
          incremental improvements over time. It was also about
          exploring my purpose, my “life’s work,” so to speak, and how the
          trials I endured this year led me closer than ever to finding it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though this is a review of my own personal experience this year,
          I hope you'll find some helpful tidbits you can apply to your own life!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="subsection-1" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          Setting
          <span class="emphasis">Intentions</span>
        </h2>

        <p>
          As 2023 began, I wasn’t in a great mental space. I was in an unhealthy
          spot in my relationship, was beginning to think I’d never get to own
          the business I’d poured myself into for six years, and had a complete
          and staggering lack of purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faced with a future of uncertainty, one where I wasn’t sure if I’d
          continue to have my partner, my house, or even my job, I had to start
          figuring things out. I knew I could stay at my job, but I didn’t know
          if it was the right choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same went for my relationship, and other lingering elements of my
          life I hadn’t come to terms with yet, but desperately needed to face.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started by trying to find my purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth is, I had no idea how to face those decisions at the time,
          let alone how to make the right choices. I didn’t know where I was
          trying to go. I would get so stuck each time, paralyzed by the fear
          of what could go wrong, that I’d forget to look at the potential upside.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, when I was setting goals for the year, that’s exactly what my
          focus was: I wanted to figure out my purpose, and who I wanted to
          become.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m turning 30 next year, which I'm honestly kind of excited about,
          but it got me thinking nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          I knew that I loved being a dad, and that supporting our family was
          important to me. He was the light of my life, in addition of course to
          his mom and our cat. Really, I think becoming a dad irrevocably
          changed my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          See, before I became a dad I didn’t have much direction or care. I was
          depressed and kind of drifting, even when I liked my life and the
          things in it. I didn’t think much of the future and kept kicking the
          can down the road about where I was going and what my purpose would be.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I became a dad, it made me consider the future in a new way.
          I wasn’t just looking out for myself anymore; people depended on me.
          That ended up being a really healthy thing for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          So for 2023, I figured I should get it all sorted out. I was watching
          my son start to find his opinions&mdash;his preferences&mdash;and live
          according to his own interests, and it inspired me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still wanted to own Total Escape Games, but after waiting for years
          to become an owner as we hit roadblock after roadblock, I’d begun to
          realize it might not happen and that I needed to start considering
          alternatives. I'd been preparing to move into the tech industry
          already since 2020, and decided to lean further into that.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I started learning web development to support the Fill and
          Fire team better and assume more responsibility. I’d been learning
          Python already but was struggling to find practical applications for
          it besides data science and ML, which wasn’t so much my interest.
          Web development was full of applications&mdash;the ability to create a
          website on my own was exciting.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the year, I set a single rule. “Figure out where I’m going
          in life,” I told myself. This was the year of decisions. I was going
          to start building momentum and roll myself out of the rut I’d worn in
          over the years of struggling against outside influences.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          Embarking on a
          <span class="emphasis">Journey</span>
        </h2>

        <p>
          Finding my purpose was no easy task. I tried (and consumed) a great
          deal of ideas, read an enormous amount of content, and packed my days
          unreasonably busy in hopes that the things I valued would stick out.
        </p>
        <p>
          I only started taking notes on every article and video I consumed late
          into the year to begin building my knowledge base (great advice I got from reading
          <a href="https://nesslabs.com/" target="_blank" ref="external">Anne-Laure Le Cunff’s articles</a>),
          but even with it starting in October I have notes for over 75 sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          To figure out my personal life, and the tasks I value, I settled on
          trying to draw more, write more, read more, study (and code) every
          day, find a stretching routine that actually worked, and spend lots
          of time in meditation. I wasn’t sure if all of it would stick, but
          I figured trying each thing for a few weeks would quickly tell me if
          I enjoyed it and was willing to make time for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I added one activity at a time, giving it room to become a part of my
          routine (or fall off the planet) before adding the next task. As of
          writing this, I’m up to 8 activities I do every day and 2-3 more I do
          a few times a week.
        </p>

        <aside class="bonus-content">
          <h3>A Different Approach</h3>
          <p>
            Next time, rather than do a little bit of a lot of things each day,
            I’m going to try spending a couple of weeks dedicated each individual
            activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ll be curious to see if it’s more effective to make
            incremental improvements across a broad number of skills, or to dive
            deep into one skill at a time and stay in a particular area of study
            for longer.
          </p>
        </aside>

        <p>
          By building good (and healthy) routines, I started to feel better.
          I paired the above goals with eating healthier, quitting energy
          drinks, and sleeping more, which helped enormously in having the
          energy and ability to, you know, actually follow through on that huge
          list of activities I set for myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the year I paid attention to which activities invigorated me
          versus the ones that felt stressful, hard, or unpleasant. It was okay
          for an activity to feel hard or stressful (coding gets that way
          sometimes for sure, and don’t even get me started on learning to draw),
          but something that felt unpleasant was a big warning sign.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I’d really gotten underway trying new things and adding to my
          routine, I felt more productive and confident. I was learning a lot
          and was getting to see myself improve in small increments each week.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strongly believe setting that foundation helped me to make the
          grueling decisions ahead of me for the rest of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choosing to leave my relationship and break apart the family was
          an immensely difficult decision, and I'll leave it at that. But it was
          a decision I had to commit to, one way or the other, and it feels good
          to at least know I've made it to the other side.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, I realized it was time to move on. It was the
          hardest decision I’ve ever made, and maybe ever will make. I think
          I'll always be grateful we resolved things peacefully, and that I
          still get to visit regularly, see my son (and cat), and even spend
          fun, happy times with my ex-partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don’t think navigating the end of our relationship is a transferable
          skill, nor would I like to repeat the process of separating. But in
          the end, it did push me to figure out what I truly valued in life and
          carve out time/effort for those things, and it especially forced me to
          be willing to make other difficult decisions in my life because, by
          comparison, they were easy.

        <p>
          In the end, I (mostly) came through! I have a much stronger sense of
          purpose now, and I’ve begun to learn which parts of my life are
          invigorating and which ones make me crazy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the year, I:

        <ul>

          I discovered a new love for web development. I was infatuated
          with the tech industry overall and had been loving the challenges
          we’d been working to overcome with Fill and Fire. But that was UX and
          Product Design. Getting to actually code and implement the interfaces,
          the designs, the animations, and the user experience improvements
          myself was mesmerizing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent a lot of time exploring my drawing habits. What I discovered
          is I don’t like feeling like I <b>have</b> to draw for some kind of
          deadline, but that having specific prompts helps force me to improve. Doing
          <a href="https://inktober.com/" target="_blank" ref="external">Inktober</a>
          was an amazing exercise, and while it was pretty stressful, I loved the results of what I was able to create.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally making the time to read books was amazing. I love it a lot.
          Like way more than I like reading articles, and especially more than I
          like reading newsletters. The latter is because I realized after subscribing
          to tons of different ones all year that I dislike newsletters on average.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found a couple of great newsletters which I still read daily.
          <a href="https://nesslabs.com/newsletter" target="_blank" ref="external">The Maker Mind Newsletter</a>
          from Anne-Laure Le Cunff is an excellent resource for getting to know
          ourselves better and setting our lives up for success.
          <a href="https://every.to/" target="_blank" ref="external">Every</a>
          is a beautifully crafted daily newsletter that never fails to surprise
          and delight me (not to mention teach me new ideas).
        </p>
        <p>
          But I probably cut 10-12 others from my routine throughout the year.
          The pressure of having an inbox full of reading every morning was
          awful, stressful, and bad. I started each day feeling behind. So that
          got cut pretty quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignoring digital content, I also read 8 full books this year. I
          thoroughly enjoyed 6 of them (including
          <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/30066684" target="_blank" ref="nofollow external">Star Trek: The Classic Episodes</a>),
          felt okay about one, and hated another. I learned that I enjoy
          nonfiction in moderation, but that not all nonfiction writing is
          equal, and I have no patience for books packed with filler.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, after many years, I managed to get into the groove with daily
          meditations and stretching, and am happy to say I can <i>comfortably</i>
          touch my toes for the first time since I was in high school and
          actively involved in martial arts.

          Finding
          <span class="emphasis">Purpose</span>
        </h2>

        <p>
          It turns out, there’s more to me than being a dad. It also turns out
          that being a dad is really damn important to me. Go figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          My son is still my number one priority, and I'm excited to watch him
          continue to grow, learn, and develop as a person. His happiness is
          infinitely linked to my own, and even in the most challenging of times,
          having him in my life helps push me forward and encourages me to be
          the best version of myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's been hard balancing my ambitions against being in his life often
          enough for him to feel secure, but it's a balancing act I must learn
          to master. Though I've discovered a strong passion for business and
          entrepreneurship this year, I refuse to be an absentee parent, and
          am keeping that top-of-mind as I continue to progress in my career.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, as this post is published, I am officially one of three
          owners of Total Escape Games, joined by two long-time business
          partners and dear friends of mine! It feels like a new chapter of my
          life has just begun, like this is a moment I’ll remember deep into my
          later years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel a great sense of purpose and accomplishment in the work I’ve
          done for the store, both in building a great experience for customers
          and in learning to become a good, ethical manager who takes care of
          his team. Getting to finally own the business is a huge breath of
          fresh air, and has revitalized my excitement to keep running the store.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, another piece of my purpose-puzzle is building
          community and creating great experiences. I deeply enjoy
          achieving big goals through my business prowess and growing industry
          knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reconnected with my Psychology degree throughout this year, finding
          new parallels between what I learned in school and UX, business
          leadership, marketing, and effective website design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tying all those pieces together helped me realize I do love
          Psychology, just not in the clinical sense. I value practical
          Psychology, easily applied to life’s problems and goals, rather than
          the overly cerebral conceptual Psychology of higher education.
        </p>
        <p>
          By combining all of the different disciplines I explored this year, I
          came out of the crucible with a new understanding of how all my
          seemingly-divergent interests interweave. This funneled into a single
          idea: experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I truly value, and what gets me more excited
          than anything else, is creating things that elicit a certain reaction
          from others. This applies to building websites, designing good UX,
          revising procedures and workflows, and writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Really, as long as I can create things, and those things make other
          people feel, I’m happy.

          Looking
          <span class="emphasis">Ahead</span>
        </h2>

        <p>
          For 2024, I want to focus on community outreach, business growth, and
          creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I’m officially an owner of Total Escape Games, it feels
          appropriate to spend the year focusing on business growth. I want to
          see TEG modernize, both in branding (it’s 15 years old and due for a
          facelift) and in operations. I think we’re already in a good spot,
          but I want to become truly excellent.
        </p>
        <p>
          By focusing on business, I’m starting to build my life’s work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of work, I want to connect with the local small business
          community in Broomfield, Colorado. I want to join the local chamber of
          commerce, spend more time partnering up with business owners in the
          area, and help grow the community with my expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m also excited to learn from the incredible business owners in the
          area.
        </p>
        <p>
          By engaging with the community, getting to know other professionals in
          the area, and providing valuable services to the people around me, I
          can also contribute to my budding life’s work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I want to expand my creative outlets. I’m already working to
          become proficient at using Adobe Illustrator, and have been using
          InDesign a lot more, which means I get to create more graphics and
          design elements for work and my other projects. I also want to create
          some cool personal pieces of art, and have already queued up a 30-day
          drawing exercise for next year.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          Drawing
          <span class="emphasis">Conclusions</span>
        </h2>

        <p>
          At the beginning of 2023, I thought the world was more black and
          white. I felt like things were either good or bad, and decisions were
          either right or wrong. I agonized over making the “right” decisions
          and choosing the “good” things.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I’ve realized, however, is that often things exist more on a
          spectrum than a binary scale. Decisions tend to be neither right nor
          wrong, and either choice has consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being able to realize this truth has helped me get unstuck and start
          moving forward again. I made some difficult choices this year, and
          those decisions freed me up to explore my future.
        </p>
        <p>
          That freedom helped me make incremental changes to my life, explore my
          own history and mind, and find a deep passion for the human experience.
          I’ve begun to walk the path ahead of me towards my life’s work.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I had to leave you with one takeaway from this year, one piece of
          advice if you’re experiencing any of the struggles I’ve felt, it’s this:
          <strong>just make a decision</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The agony leading up to the decision is usually far worse than the
          consequences and clean-up of the decision itself. And you can’t move
          forward, and find what you love in life, if you’re not willing to make
          hard choices.
        </p>
        <p>
          So start making decisions. Try a new food. Explore a new hobby. Visit
          a new place. Then, if you love it, lean in. If you don’t, make the
          decision to stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just, whatever you do, try to make the choice yourself. Because if
          you don’t, I've discovered the people and circumstances around you
          tend to eventually make them for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember: life is what you make of it, and it’s your story to tell.
        </p>
        <p>Happy New Year, and may we all find success in 2024!</p>
