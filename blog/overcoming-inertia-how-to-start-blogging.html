          What better way to overcome my inertia about blogging than to help
          teach you how to get rolling in your own life, too? It's a sort of
          meta-blog if you will. I've also been writing on Threads since it
          came out, which is also a sort of Meta blog, you know.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bad jokes aside, let's learn how to get started with a new idea.
          Maybe it's a blog–the example I’ll be using throughout this post–or
          maybe it's a new product you want to develop, a book you want to
          write, a hike you want to take, or anything else. It can be big, but
          it's probably best to give yourself a break with something small
          and easily achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frankly, the best way to start something new is to just do it. Which,
          if you're like me, is totally unhelpful advice. So let's unpack that!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="left-align" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 class="centered blog-subtitle">
          Setting
          <span class="emphasis">goals</span>
          that won't trip you
        </h2>

        <p>
          Have you ever set a New Year's resolution?
          <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2980864/" target="_blank">According to recent research</a>,
          while 77% of people can follow through on these goals for a
          week, only 19% found success across two years. This means you and
          I are not alone in shrugging off our new commitments by January 12th.
        </p>
        <p>
          The good news is, it’s not our fault! Well, sort of, anyway.
          The problem with New Year’s resolutions as I’ve tended to see them
          implemented is they don’t have any tangible measure of success,
          or the goal stretches too far into the future. For example,
          going to blog this year,” or “I’m going to start exercising.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the last two years, I’ve become a mastermind of new habit
          formation. It’s almost too good. Sometimes I start doing something
          casually for the fun of it and before I know it, that thing’s been
          absorbed into my routine. I’ve also set exactly zero New Year’s resolutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do this by focusing on <strong>one thing at a time</strong> and
          adding it slowly into my routine, as desired. Most recently,
          that’s been writing (and by extension, blogging). When I first
          started the process 3 months ago, my goal was to write once a week.
          I didn’t set an amount of writing. A paragraph was the same as an
          essay as an entire chapter book in fulfilling the goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then it escalated to twice a week with the same rules. Then twice a
          week with the requirement to at least write a paragraph each time,
          and focus my writing towards the eventual goal of blog posts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, three months later, I consistently write 3 to 5 times per week
          without even thinking about it, and I am training myself to focus
          that impulse better by fixating on blog posts.
        </p>
        <p>
          To generalize that, the steps to building a new habit roughly
          shake out to the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Set a modest, achievable, and measurable goal. T
            his should be easy to accomplish. It’s about confidence building.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pick a time and place where each day you’ll work towards the goal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue to achieve that goal for a few weeks. Notice how good it
            feels to achieve your goal. Live in that excitement and compliment
            your dedication.
          </li>
          <li>
            Increase the scope of the goal (slightly). Add another day
            each week of that activity, or increase the intensity. Keep it
            achievable and small, but larger than it used to be.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once again reinforce your success, and address roadblocks if you
            slip. Keep trying until you consistently achieve this goal for 3-5 weeks.
          </li>
          <li>
            Increase the intensity (you’re starting to get the trend now, I bet).
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue scaling up the intensity until you’ve achieved your
            larger, overarching goal.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          What if you don’t have a larger goal for it to feed into?
          Thankfully, you don’t need it. In my case, I had a focused endpoint,
          but if creating the new habit is the endpoint, then the above
          is enough to get you most of the way there.
          <a href="https://jamesclear.com/new-habit#:~:text=On%20average%2C%20it%20takes%20more,to%20form%20a%20new%20habit." target="_blank">On average it takes 66 days for a habit to form.</a>
          For some people, it’ll be less, and for others, it’ll be much longer.
          Your job, throughout that process, is to stay as consistent as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          In case you don’t believe me,
          <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.674" target="_blank">here’s even more research.</a>

          I’m having
          <span class="emphasis">trouble</span>
          even getting started
        </h2>

        <p>
          Okay, so easier said than done, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          In my experience, getting the ball rolling is the hardest part.
          That’s why this blog is titled “Overcoming Inertia,” instead of
          “Casually Rolling to Success,” or something else ridiculous.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’ve ever moved furniture out of a rut in the carpet, you know
          from experience. The first motion out of your resting place is the
          hardest. Your resting place might be an established routine, a lie
          you’re telling yourself, or an overburdening of commitments that
          leave you feeling paralyzed.
        </p>
        <p>
          All is not lost, however. There are some tried and true methods to
          take that first step and begin building momentum. The best news of
          all is that momentum is surprisingly hard to lose once you have it.
          To parallel the earlier article about
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3505409/#b22" target="_blank">habit formation</a>,
          did you know it’s equally (or even more) difficult to
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9117234/" target="_blank">break a habit</a>?
        </p>
        <p>
          For this, let’s look at how writers and artists overcome a blank page:
          make a mark, any mark, and remove the decision paralysis from the
          equation altogether. I believe that the first mark is similar to the
          first push of momentum. By removing the paralysis of infinite
          possibilities, you help yourself narrow down to what matters most.
          If you’re trying to code, try writing a nonsense line of code at the
          top of the page, or add a comment detailing your intention with the
          rest of the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          More recently, AI has helped me overcome inertia quite a bit by
          allowing me to quickly generate a first draft to expand on afterward.
          AI then acts as the first movement, allowing me to neatly slip in and
          begin editing and rearranging. While I strongly caution you against
          using AI-generated output without review, it’s a great way to at
          least get started.

          There’s a fascinating trend occurring lately called
          <a href="https://add.org/the-body-double/" target="_blank">body doubling</a>,
          which is essentially working alongside another person to force
          yourself to stay focused. Sitting beside someone (or even in the same
          room) as someone doing work encourages you to get productive as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          In truth, there is no end to the methods possible to take the first
          step. For me, I tend to sit at a local coffee shop when I know I need
          fewer distractions, or get started by generating a first draft with AI.
          For you, it can be anything that gets you moving. Maybe it’s light
          stretching or a walk. Maybe it’s an inspiring conversation with a
          friend, or playing with your pet for a minute.

          You’ll find yours–experiment with different methods to make that
          first mark or start your routine and see what gets you into the flow
          quickest.

          The elusive
          <span class="emphasis">flow</span>
        </h2>

        <p>
          If you’ve been on the internet in, oh, the last few years, you’ve
          probably come across the idea of flow. Especially common amongst
          coders, designers, artists, and athletes, flow is essentially the
          state of losing yourself in an activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people have studied flow, and there’s a great deal of information
          available on the physiological and neurological changes that happen
          <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.645498/full" target="_blank">when someone enters flow</a>.
          Yet, getting yourself into flow is more difficult than the research
          might suggest, and simultaneously way easier than you’re anticipating.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first step is not to overthink. Thinking about flow is maddeningly
          likely to make it less likely you achieve it. Thinking about anything
          too much makes it hard to enter flow. When we spend our time thinking,
          we’re focused internally, whereas flow requires external focus on a
          task or process. Without engaging with the outside world, you’ll
          struggle to reach flow and, thus, get as productive as you’d like.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flow helps develop healthy habits, and to grow the habits we already
          have. Say I’ve started blogging–I’ve taken that first step–and now
          I need to perform. Flow is how I go from writing little bits of blogs
          over several weeks to banging out an entire draft in an afternoon.
          It’s also how to have great editing sessions, develop new features,
          design a logo, or train for a marathon.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, we know why it’s helpful and how to not achieve flow, but how do
          we get ourselves into this magical state? The process is pretty simple:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            First, we engage in an activity we’re familiar with, that we know
            intrinsically and don’t have to think to accomplish. The phrase
            “like riding a bike” comes to mind, where once you’ve learned it
            you don’t have to think it through each time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, we have to focus on that activity. If we’re multitasking or
            overthinking, we’re an obstacle to ourselves.
          </li>
          <li>
            The activity then has to be appropriately difficult. If it’s too
            easy we get bored or distracted, and if it’s too hard we get
            frustrated, hit roadblocks, and give up. Finding the edge of what
            you can do and what you can’t do is essential to flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            From there, we’re set. Just focus on completing that activity to the
            best of your ability, challenges and all, and watch yourself grow.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Flow is essential not only in overcoming inertia but also in excelling
          at a new hobby once we’ve taken the first steps and feel more familiar.
          Flow helps us overcome the feeling of stagnation that comes from doing
          something repeatedly without pushing ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          In turn, pushing ourselves helps us overcome future roadblocks by
          maintaining discipline and momentum in our lives.

          Forming
          <span class="emphasis">habits</span>
          we just can’t break
        </h2>

        <p>
          Okay, so we’re masters of the first step. We’re masters of challenging
          ourselves in tasks and feeling at home with them. That’s great because
          our work toward getting a new habit under control is well underway.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last piece, truly, is consistency.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve known some gifted artists. Artists who, when they apply themselves,
          create works of art that easily rival anything I’ve seen online with
          hundreds of thousands of views. But they don’t get those views.
          They don’t get much of anything, sometimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why does that happen?
        </p>
        <p>
          It comes down to two things: lack of discipline and/or lack of
          consistency, which are two sides of the same coin.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're unlikely to be consistent if you’re not disciplined–if you
          can’t overcome discomfort and hold yourself accountable, you’ll
          struggle to keep yourself on track. Conversely, if you aren’t
          consistent then it’s difficult to be disciplined because you keep
          changing focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          While talent and skill certainly play a role in success, and in
          overcoming inertia through sheer confidence, they’re not enough to
          help us build a habit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Instead, we need to maintain ourselves.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ll write an entire blog post on discipline, and maybe another on
          consistency, in due time. For now, I’ll give a quick summary that’s
          enough for you to at least grasp the concepts and embed them into
          your pursuit of goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discipline comes from accountability. There’s a
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PafvhTSC4yE" target="_blank">great Diary of a CEO episode </a>
          on this with an expert in the subject, Ryan Holiday, that I strongly
          recommend if you can spare the 90 minutes. Otherwise, read on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your ability to stay disciplined comes from holding yourself to your
          own goals, values, and expectations. If you identify as an early riser,
          you’re way more likely to get up early. Similarly, if you snooze your
          alarm every morning and sleep in, you’re not holding yourself
          accountable to your ideals and will slip from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some would suggest an action as simple as making your bed in the
          morning makes you significantly more likely to stay accountable and
          get things done throughout the day. I’ve personally found success with
          this, but not enough to peddle it here. Feel free to try it out for
          yourself and see how it feels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, focus your attention on your actions and make sure they
          match your intentions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can do that, you can stay consistent. Consistency arises from
          a desire to repeatedly do a task, or at least achieve the outcome by
          working diligently on that task and sticking to it. If you keep
          yourself accountable, you’ll stay in the pocket of your goal and are
          thus significantly more likely to accomplish it.

          it all together
        </h2>

        <p>
          If you’re reading this, then it means this advice worked on me!
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, if you’re not reading this then I’m talking to
          myself and maybe I should follow my own advice. In fact, let's
          recap the different steps to getting started in a new hobby and
          building a new habit:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Set realistic, achievable goals to strive towards
          </li>
          <li>
            Take the first step to avoid inaction and paralysis
          </li>
          <li>
            Get used to repeating that step, get comfortable, and find flow
          </li>
          <li>
            Build the habit with consistency and discipline
          </li>
          <li>
            Achieve your goals and build confidence
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And that’s it! When reading through this it might seem like a lot,
          but much of it happens automatically when you’re heading down the
          right path. It’s built into who we are as humans. If you haven’t
          formed any habits already, then you’re also not brushing your teeth
          or taking care of yourself in other ways, which seems like a higher
          priority than reading my blog.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your body knows what to do. It’s designed to build habits, from your
          nervous system to your muscles, and <em>especially</em> your brain.
          A lot of the processing our brain does in a day is due to habits, or
          heuristics, that help us get through the day without succumbing to
          information overload. Especially in the modern world, with
          information at our fingertips.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you still struggle, just keep trying. Remember, consistency is
          worth more than anything at this step. Even if you don’t feel proud
          of your accomplishments, keep trying. You’ll be amazed how far
          sticking to a goal will get you over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Good luck building your habits, and I’ll see you next time.
