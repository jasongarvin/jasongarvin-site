          Finally owning the business I'd been managing went from feeling like I
          had things locked down to feeling like I’d been thrown from a moving
          ship into a bottomless ocean in the middle of a hurricane.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd done great as a manager. The store was thriving. And with a
          hands-off owner, I'd been largely responsible for the business strategy
          already. I thought at first that business ownership would be mostly
          the same as what I'd already been doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          So imagine my surprise when I realized that I and my business partners
          had not only full control, but full responsibility. It
          called all of my decision-making practices into question, cut my
          confidence in half, and put me in unfamiliar territory where I had to
          scramble to figure out what to do next.
        </p>
        <p>
          While running the business was still familiar, the wave of new
          tasks and responsibilities caught me off guard. Besides that, it's
          different making decisions for your own business than working in
          someone else's business. It's higher stakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I went through several phases as I rebuilt my confidence and got used
          to the new workload and responsiblity. I’m here now to help you shortcut
          that learning curve, so you can start making better decisions today.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were three big realizations I had in getting used to owning a
          business this year:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Don't overthink it.
            <a class="body-link" href="#subsection-1">Think less to achieve more</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a class="body-link" href="#subsection-2">Big decisions demand deep thought.</a>
            It’s okay to overthink sometimes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a class="body-link" href="#subsection-3">Don’t sweat the small stuff.</a>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          That might sound a bit silly for now, but go with it. I promise
          I’ll explain in due time. I discovered each of those three
          points, in order, over the past 8 months as I learned to steer the
          business better and navigated my new 3-person partnership owner
          dynamic.

        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          Think Less to Achieve More
        </h2>

        <p>
          When I first became a business owner, I was worried about messing
          something up. So, to compensate, I took a ton of time on every
          decision and labored over each fork in the road because I wanted to
          feel like I was doing the right thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          At times that was correct, and we’ll get to that shortly, but a lot of
          the time it wasn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you ever feel like, looking back, you spent way too long to make a
          choice that ended up being pretty meaningless?
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s how I felt a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’d spend hours making a decision, feel good about my choice for a
          minute, and then after another minute realize that choice was
          gone to time. After all that agony, it had barely any effect on
          the business at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realized over time that most decisions weren't dire.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two types of people when it comes to decision-making
          (and you can be a bit of both):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Maximizers, who try to weigh every possibility and make the
            <em>best decision</em>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Satisficers, who find the first decision that looks
            <em>good enough</em> and take it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It may be unsurprising to find out Satisficers are, on average, much
          happier people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turns out I'm more of a Maximizer. It also turns out that spending
          hours and hours on every little decision is exhausting and bad for
          your mental health. I went through that during the first couple
          months of 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, to combat the inherent worry as a business owner that making the
          wrong decision could have awful, terrible, really bad results, we have
          to try to lean further into being a Satisficer. At least when it comes
          to smaller decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of it this way. Is this decision business critical? That is,
          does this decision change the shape or path of the business forever?
          Is it irreversible?
        </p>
        <p>
          If the answer to any of those questions is no, then you can probably
          save yourself some pain and make a quicker decision without
          overthinking it.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="subsection-2" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          Big Decisions Demand Deep Thought
        </h2>

        <p>
          What if you said yes to some of those questions, though?
        </p>
        <p>
          What if it is business critical, or changes the path of your business,
          or can never be reversed? Well, then yes, you should take your time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re considering a major pivot from a product to a subscription
          model, from one audience to another, or entirely redefining your
          company structure, maybe don’t make that decision overnight. The same
          goes for picking new manufacturers or locking yourself into anything
          else that comes with a contract and strict requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a lot of money’s involved then that’s doubly true.
        </p>
        <p>
          After learning to relax this year, I got hit with a few large
          decisions that the business had to navigate, and I realized that
          relying on intuition alone wasn’t going to get me through to the
          other side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, we’d have meetings where all 3 of us would attend and weigh
          our options. We looked into data, sales trends, local demographics,
          city planning, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          We learned to lean on data and analysis to make sure our
          intuition was backed up by numbers, and even further to make sure we
          could try our best to understand the possible outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where it pays off to think like a Maximizer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Find all the reasonable options you can. If you’re considering a big
          decision, first define what’s important to you. Set the criteria. What
          is your budget? What’s your biggest concern (convenience,
          comprehensiveness, quality)?
        </p>
        <p>
          That helps narrow the scope of your question so you don’t get totally
          buried in options.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, gather up all the reasonable options that fit the criteria
          you’ve chosen. From there you can start to compare them to one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is one a significantly better deal? Or has better customer service?
          Is one a long-time successful company you can depend on being around
          for a while? Is one a small startup that’s super scrappy and willing
          to try things you really like that others won't?
        </p>
        <p>
          Maximizing a choice is great in times like these, because it lets you
          really dig into the meat of the question until you feel like you have
          a strong understanding of the situation and the possible next steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Realizing when to take my time helped me navigate some major product
          releases, find a new bank, and negotiate our lease and plan out where
          our business would be for the next few years.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="subsection-3" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff
        </h2>

        <p>
          That said, I overcorrected when I realized that sometimes my
          natural habit to Maximize decisions was correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was so excited, because in my personal life I’m so, so guilty of
          taking a long time on decisions even when I really don’t need to.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, I spent 2 weeks looking through electric kettles
          to pick a new one for my apartment. That’s absurd. Even worse,
          I ended up buying the first one I'd seen anyway (it's an absolute
          dream though, to be fair).
        </p>
        <p>
          So my final realization this year was to not sweat the small stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you need to take your time on decisions, but sometimes you
          really don’t, and that’s okay!
        </p>
        <p>
          Picking a new internet provider for the business doesn’t need to be a
          long process. It’s already a pain in the ass dealing with the internet
          we already have, and if I don’t like the one we’re trying I can switch
          to the next. Realistically, they’re all going to be mediocre and kind
          of annoying.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that needs to be a quick decision. 30 minutes or less. Because I
          have other, bigger decisions to make that do actually need my time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If my first realization was learning to make quick decisions, and my
          second realization was learning to sometimes dig really deep into
          decisions, then my third realization was understanding just how few
          decisions really deserve the stress I give them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reality is, 80% of the decisions we make from day to day as
          business owners don’t have a big impact. If you have a certain goal,
          and you’re moving in the direction of that goal, you’ll naturally make
          a good enough choice. Satisfice your way through.
        </p>
        <p>
          These decisions aren’t where we make or break our businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, save all that time and effort for the last 20% of the
          choices. The ones that lead to 80% of the outcomes for your business.
          The ones that really matter and shape your future.
        </p>
