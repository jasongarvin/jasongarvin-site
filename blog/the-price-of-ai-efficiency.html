        <p>
          AI has been a major part of our lives for over a year, ever since the
          release of ChatGPT by OpenAI. The explosion of AI-related tools and
          products, not to mention wild claims of future utopias (or death by
          robot) are abundant in all forms of media today.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, how are you feeling about it so far?
        </p>
        <p>
          As a forward-thinking tech enthusiast, a creative, and a business
          owner, I’ve thought about AI a lot. I’ve seen countless AI products
          encroach in my skill space. Chances are you’ve felt this pressure
          too&mdash;the power AI exerts over us when we consider our future.
        </p>
        <p>
          To better understand that future, I spent the past few months
          relentlessly digging into AI to learn everything I could. I explored
          how it works, built and trained models, played around in every sandbox
          I found, and used several AI-powered apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I’ve discovered is that AI probably won’t be apocalyptic, and
          neither will it save us. It’s more likely for AI to lead the charge
          into the next evolution of technology and modern tools, and change
          how we connect with the world as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’ll be a source of economic growth within capitalism. If we’re
          lucky, it’ll empower everyday people to explore ideas and skills we
          didn’t know we had, too.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="subsection-1" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          Clarifying AI's
          <span class="emphasis">Existence</span>
        </h2>

        <p>
          AI is a fascinating tool. It’s amazing at analyzing data, at
          brainstorming, and at supporting human thought. It also makes a
          surprisingly good companion in some cases, and can provide mentorship
          and insight at an incredible pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, AI is not human. It’s not a conscious entity with
          its own needs. It’s a tool created by tech companies as another means
          of innovation. It’s a product. A way to create new markets and provide
          utility to the public at a cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          This makes AI fascinating, but it also makes it dangerous to us as
          consumers. We need to remember that AI is similar to the wave of SaaS
          apps that came before it. We need to remember that AI is a technology
          being created by businesses in the interest of profit and growth, not
          a benevolent (or malicious) force with a mind of its own.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when we look at AI and its effect on the world, let’s consider it
          from that perspective. Set aside the Hollywood ideals of AI and its
          possible sentience. Set aside the doomsday and utopian scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI solves a great many problems, creates others, and acts as a bridge
          between many professional and creative pursuits.
        </p>
        <p>
          It threatens to change the definition of work and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          It promises to change what it means to be human, and how we connect
          with the technology around us. But even still, it’s a tool. An
          innovation. So let’s consider it as such.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="subsection-2" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          <span class="emphasis">Business</span>
          Goals and AI
        </h2>

        <p>
          If there were ever a product designed to make businesses excited, it’s
          AI. It makes operations more efficient. It’s cost-effective as hell.
          It’s new, it’s shiny, and it promises to shrink your overhead while
          improving productivity. What’s not to like?
        </p>
        <p>
          When I see marketing for AI tools, it tends to be the same. “10x your
          productivity,” they say. “Automate key segments of [this work] to save
          yourself and your team time.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s hyperbolic statements about how AI will single-handedly make your
          business a success and give you free time back so you can go party on
          the beach. It’s a solopreneur’s dream: convenient help with tedious
          tasks without the burden of payroll.
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, how many tools are coming out claiming to leverage AI
          that actually improve the work we do? A lot of it feels like vaporware.
          A lot of it is vaporware. But there are some incredible outliers.
        </p>
        <p>
          ChatGPT, and other large language models (LLMs), are changing people’s
          lives. Writing a report, doing research, drafting up a presentation,
          and other tedious tasks have never been easier or more accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s not a silver bullet. LLMs hallucinate. But it’s an amazing
          improvement for anyone who needs to brainstorm work, generate drafts,
          test ideas, or do quick research into a subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          LLMs solve a real need.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s the same with
          <a href="https://www.notion.so/product/ai" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">Notion’s AI summarization feature</a>
          when I’m otherwise stuck in a maze of notes I’ve left myself trying to
          find a small piece of information.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI has an incredible ability to summarize data.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when we look at AI’s role in business, it’s easy to see where it
          shines. We can process loads more data, which leads to better insights
          and quicker decision-making when implementing features and pivoting
          sales objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is how AI is marketed, and the major source of why companies are
          receiving funding. VC firms want to support AI endeavors as the tool
          of the future. CEOs and business leaders want AI to streamline their
          business and make their payroll leaner.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI is a great tool to empower decision-makers in business. It’s a huge
          boon, and it has a lot of really interesting applications that
          undoubtedly make business more efficient. But, those same applications
          only have dubious success in making life fulfilling.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a limitation of AI. It makes us more productive and supports
          decision-making, but do businesses really need to be more efficient at
          this? Is maximum efficiency using AI even worth it?
        </p>
        <p>
          Is chasing the legendary $1b valuation worth anything besides bragging
          rights?
        </p>
        <p>
          The truth is, to me, business doesn’t make us happy. Business is a
          means to an end. At its best, it’s a fulfilling career and a great
          point of pride, but it’s not inherently a part of what we need as
          people to exist and thrive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Business isn’t why we’re alive. I’m saying that as a business owner.
          I know. It goes against what we hear in our peer groups, and what
          we’re sold by presentations and marketing copy, but it’s true.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="subsection-3" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          AI for the
          <span class="emphasis">People</span>
        </h2>

        <p>
          When it comes to the fulfillment of ourselves as people, it’s more
          complicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some of us, a good life may be a comfortable one. In this case, AI
          makes sense as the next step in human societal evolution. It does work
          for us, after all, and it abstracts away all that unpleasant stuff to
          get you back to reclining in the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, it makes me think of Wall-E. Not in an endearing,
          “look at the little robot trying his best,” kind of way, either. It
          makes me nervous for our future. I don’t want to be a guy in a chair
          drifting around. It’s not what makes life worthwhile.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’ve read anything from me in the past, you already know how
          important community, and human connection, is to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI threatens this, I think. AI makes it easier not to talk to people,
          going so far as to actively make it harder to reach another human. For
          example, service interactions are getting automated at an alarming
          rate. And as the surface area of human-to-human interaction shrinks,
          we get lonelier.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI makes it easier for businesses to downsize departments, and reduce
          the amount of professionals they pay. It makes it easier to automate
          art, music, and video generation. It removes entire fields of creative
          work at the lowest level.
        </p>
        <p>
          High-earning and well-respected artists will be fine. When you have a
          following, people seek you out because it’s you. But as a newer
          artist, or someone trying to learn a creative field in 2024, AI is
          scary.
        </p>
        <p>
          But AI has some really interesting applications, too. AI therapy is
          fascinating to me, and so is the idea of having an AI companion. It’s
          intimidating as a simulation of human life and as a replacement for
          human comforts, but there's real appeal for these options especially
          in extreme cases of isolation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in interpersonal life, or exercises like journaling, AI’s ability
          to process data gives us the opportunity to examine ourselves like
          never before.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI gives me insight into myself, my patterns, and the patterns of
          what’s around me in a way I could never do on my own. No amount of
          pen-and-paper journaling will give me the insights that AI can pull
          out of a long block of my own writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s a mixed bag, and it comes down to individual preferences. I have
          colleagues who are deep into AI, and are seeing huge gains in their
          personal lives because of it. I have other colleagues who are dealing
          with deep depression, have had their art stolen, or are profoundly
          struggling to adjust to an uncertain future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither side is easy. Adopting new technology is tough even at the
          best of times. But what I come back to every time is the idea of our
          future, and whether AI truly helps us arrive at the finish line we’re
          creating for ourselves.

          Evaluating the
          <span class="emphasis">Impact</span>
          of AI
        </h2>

        <p>
          It’s hard to say this early how AI will affect us. But some trends are
          becoming clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s been a lot of talk recently about the “loneliness epidemic.”
          I’ve seen it happening around me. It’s easier than ever to feel
          isolated, to be unsure how to meet people. AI makes that worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ai makes analyzing huge swaths of personal data using much easier,
          which is worrying in the hands of large companies. It makes data
          analysis all but a solved field, and gives power to those with enough
          data for AI to make strong judgments.
        </p>
        <p>
          These uses for AI lean into existing issues we've already been seeing.
          I recently
          <a href="seo-versus-humans.html">wrote about my dislike for SEO</a>,
          which is made worse by LLMs' ability to generate SEO-friendly content,
          lower the barrier to creating adequate content, and flood the
          market with mediocre writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, AI risks usurping SEO entirely by making search into an
          answer engine instead. Google
          <a href="https://torchbox.com/blog/what-do-google-ai-overviews-mean-for-seo/" target="_blank" rel="external">announced the launch of AI-generated search results</a>
          at I/O 2024, creating a lot of concern about the future of SEO and
          web searches in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          As seen at Google I/O,
          <a href="https://torchbox.com/blog/what-do-google-ai-overviews-mean-for-seo/" target="_blank" rel="external">the move towards predictive AI search results</a>
          is only the beginning of how AI will change browsing the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          Machine learning and its use in algorithms is also guilty of making
          social media problematically addictive. It gets us better stuck in the
          endless loop of scrolling by powering better-tuned algorithms.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI consolidates power and perpetuates unhealthy cycles online.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, it gives people opportunities. Being able to
          practice for an interview with a pretend interviewer is amazing.
          Getting to brainstorm with ChatGPT is inspiring. There are a great
          many applications for AI that do genuinely make our lives better, or
          at least easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s not a simple problem. We have to understand it better as
          individuals and as a society to decide its worth to us.

        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          Will
          <span class="emphasis">AI</span>
          be Good or Bad?
        </h2>

        <p>
          I wish I could pass a simple judgment. I wish it was that
          simple&mdash;that I could wrap up this post with an optimistic take,
          pat you on the back, and usher you out the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          In reality, however, AI is anything but simple. It is a far-reaching
          technology that promises to affect every aspect of our lives, from
          calling into support to researching ideas to even the work we do each
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, I think AI will be both good and bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI will do bad things when given to bad people, and lead to changes
          that hurt the rest of us. It will empower businesses to be ruthless,
          to clear out entire teams in favor of lean efficiency. It will
          automate the hiring process, separate us from our peers, and let
          algorithms decide whole parts of our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it will also create innovation, expand science, and allow us to invent
          things that used to be pure fantasy. It will give us the chance to
          learn and grow in ways we couldn’t before&mdash;it will give us resources we
          didn't have, and support we haven't before felt.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, it’s up to us to decide whether that’s worth it. Whether
          the good outweighs the bad. It’s our jobs as individual contributors,
          business leaders, and artists, to police AI and the companies
          producing it. It's our responsibility as people of this age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing our boundaries as a society will be huge in shaping how this
          technology changes the world. Now more than ever we must consider the
          future.
