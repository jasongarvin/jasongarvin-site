      <section itemprop="abstract">
        <p>
          As a forward-looking tech enthusiast and a business owner, AI has been
          on my mind for a couple of years now. I’ve been through waves of
          excitement and waves of disappointment, and over time it’s led me to
          realize that AI is perhaps not the solution to society’s problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inundated with new AI products designed to “save time and 10x my
          productivity” I've become rather numb to a lot of the marketing
          buzzwords, which has got me thinking deeper about what our AI-powered
          future really means.
        </p>
        <p>
          In particular, I think about the usefulness of AI. I wonder which
          tasks should be automated, or should be made so efficient we barely
          have to notice them at all. How important is efficiency, really?
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, who are we as humans, and what parts of ourselves are uniquely
          ours instead of something to outsource for productivity gains? What
          parts of work that I do in a day are a representation of myself, and
          which are busywork?
        </p>
        <p>
          When measuring business success, we can use a variety of keywords,
          data, and acronyms. Product-market fit. Gross revenue. Profit. KPIs.
          Growth. But I’ve noticed it’s much more difficult to nail down what
          it means to be a successful person.
        </p>
        <p>
          To some, maybe that’s money, or is deeply linked to business success,
          but I think there’s more to it than that. Being happy is both more,
          and less, than something you can measure like objective success.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="subsection-1" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          <span class="emphasis">Business</span>
          Goals and AI
        </h2>

        <p>
          If there were ever a product designed to make business owners excited,
          it’s AI. It makes operations more efficient. It’s cost-effective as
          hell. It’s new, it’s shiny, and it promises to scale down your
          overhead while growing your productivity and innovation. What’s not
          to like?
        </p>
        <p>
          When I see the marketing for AI tools, it’s always the same. “10x your
          productivity,” they’ll say. “Automate key segments of [this work] to
          save yourself and your team time.” It’s hyperbolic statements about
          how AI will single handedly make your business a success and give you
          all your free time back so you can go party on the beach.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interesting part is how many tools are coming out claiming to
          leverage AI versus the number of them that actually work and improve
          the average employee’s workflow. A lot of it feels like vaporware, but
          there are some incredible outliers.
        </p>
        <p>
          ChatGPT, and other large language models, are changing people’s lives.
          Writing an essay, doing research, drafting up a presentation, and
          other tedious tasks have never been easier or more accessible. Now,
          they’ve also never been more prone to error–hallucinations are a real
          issue and this work still has to be double-checked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, they solve a real need. It’s the same with Notion’s AI when I’m
          browsing through the maze of notes I’ve left myself trying to find a
          small piece of information. Or when I want an AI coach to analyze my
          thoughts over the past few weeks and help me find common trends.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI has an incredible ability to synthesize data. It’s truly amazing.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when we look at AI’s role in business, and its usefulness, it’s
          pretty easy to see where it shines. We can process loads more data,
          which leads to better insights and quicker decision-making when
          implementing features and pivoting sales objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI is a great tool to empower decision-makers in business. It’s a huge
          boon, and it has a lot of really interesting applications which I’m
          about to ignore. Applications that undoubtedly make business more
          efficient, but that are outside of the scope of this post because
          they don’t inherently make a person more fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honestly, business isn’t why we’re alive. I’m saying that as a
          business owner. I know. It goes against what we hear in our peer
          groups, and what we’re sold by presentations and marketing copy, but
          it’s true.
        </p>

          Goals and AI
        </h2>

        <p>
          When it comes to fulfillment for ourselves as people, it gets more complicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some of us, a good life may be a comfortable one. In this case, AI
          makes sense as the next step in human societal evolution. It does work
          for us, after all, and it abstracts away all that unpleasant stuff to
          get you back to reclining in the sun.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, it makes me think of Wall-E, and not in a good,
          cute, “oh my god look at the little robot,” kind of way. It makes me
          nervous for our future. I don’t want to be a guy in a chair drifting
          around. It’s not what makes life worthwhile.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’ve read anything from me in the past, you already know how
          important community is to me, and how much time I spend thinking about
          humans in terms of our connection to one another. I also spend a lot
          of time exploring how we connect to the world around us.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI threatens this balance, I think. AI makes it easier not to talk to
          people, and actually makes it less likely to even be able to talk to
          someone. For example, service interactions are becoming automated. And
          as the surface area of human-to-human interaction shrinks, we get lonelier.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI has some really interesting applications here, though. AI therapy
          is fascinating to me, and so is the idea of having an AI companion.
          It’s scary as a simulacrum for human life and as a replacement for
          human comforts, but I also understand the appeal and accessibility of
          such options especially in extreme cases of isolation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in interpersonal life, or exercises like journaling, AI’s ability
          to process data gives us the opportunity to examine ourselves like
          never before.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s a mixed bag, and it comes down to individual preferences. I have
          friends who have doven deep into AI and who are seeing huge gains in
          their personal lives because of it. I have other friends and
          colleagues, however, who are dealing with deep depression, have had
          their art stolen, or are profoundly struggling to adjust to an
          uncertain future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither side is easy. Adopting new technology is tough even at the
          best of times. But what I come back to every time is the idea of our
          future, and whether AI truly helps us arrive at the finish line we’re
          imagining for ourselves.

          Evaluating the
          <span class="emphasis">Impact</span>
          of AI
        </h2>

        <p>
          It’s hard to say, especially this early, how AI will affect us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We didn’t realize the long-term impact of social media until years
          after we were all addicted to it and it’d become a major part of life.
          Even now we’re discovering new and insidious ways that social media
          undermines our friendships and our happiness, even despite its many
          benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is that going to be AI in a few years?
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s been a lot of talk recently about the “loneliness epidemic,”
          and I’ve seen it happening around me, as well. It’s easier than ever
          to feel isolated, to be unsure how to meet people. AI makes that worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI, and machine learning in general, is also guilty for much of the
          social media addictiveness and nastiness. It makes the wide-scale use
          of our personal data that much scarier in the hands of large tech companies.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, on the other hand, it gives people incredible opportunities.
          Being able to practice for an interview with a pretend interviewer is
          amazing. Getting to brainstorm with ChatGPT is inspiring.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI is, like many of the other elements we face in our modern lives,
          not a simple problem to approach.

          Is
          <span class="emphasis">AI</span>
          Good or Bad?
        </h2>

        <p>
          I wish I could tell you. I wish it was that simple, that I could wrap
          up this post with an optimistic take and a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          In truth, I think AI will be both good and bad. It will be both. It
          will do things and lead to changes that hurt people. It will also
          create innovation and improvements that make things we used to
          consider fantasy into reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be up to us to decide whether that’s worth it. Whether the
          good outweighs the bad, and to police AI and the companies producing
          it when we feel their interests stop aligning with our own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Policing AI, and knowing our boundaries as a society and as a people
          will be huge in shaping how this technology changes the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          And AI will change the world.
