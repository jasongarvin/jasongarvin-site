        <p>
          I did an audit recently of every task I do throughout the day and my
          mental state. The results were horrifying.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I discovered is, essentially, this:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I change tasks way too frequently, often not by choice.
          </li>
          <li>
            I get mentally fatigued as the day goes on.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It turns out that when I have to totally reframe my mind and spend
          time jumping into a new task over, and over, and over again, I get
          tired and less effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chances are good you might be suffering from this, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Context switching, also known as the insidious process of mentally
          hopping from bucket to bucket, is exhausting. It makes you spend time
          orienting yourself to new tasks way more times in a day than you
          should, and it’s destructive.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let’s talk about it. How do you, or I, avoid it? What can we do to
          mitigate its effects when we can’t avoid it?
        </p>
        <p>
          After realizing the toll it was taking on my work efficiency and
          mental health, I went on a deep dive to understand this mysterious
          beast and hopefully slay it for good.

          Describing Context Switching
        </h2>

        <p>
          So what is context switching, exactly? Basically, it’s the act of
          switching from one knowledge space–context–to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contexts are specific topics, tasks, or processes you’re operating
          within. Sometimes that can be as broad as “marketing” or as specific
          as “buying collectible card games.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Switching between contexts comes in many forms, but most commonly
          happens when you’re trying to focus on a long-form task and get
          interrupted by urgent communications, meetings, or other
          time-sensitive work.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my own life, it often comes from switching between trying to write
          procedures and checking out customers, or taking a break from
          designing our website to offer board game recommendations.
        </p>
        <p>
          At times it’s just a minor setback, but it can also totally derail
          work and force us to reacquaint ourselves with certain tasks or
          knowledge multiple times.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some great resources throughout this article that go deeper
          into the different mechanisms behind context switching, how it works,
          and why it can affect us so negatively. I highly recommend them all if
          you like understanding topics deeply.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article by Atlassian covers
          <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/context-switching" target="_blank" rel="external">context switching’s effect on productivity</a>
          and includes some easy-to-understand graphics about what goes on
          behind the scenes when you switch contexts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>But for the purposes of this post, it’s enough to simply know that
          context switching happens when we have to change our thoughts and/or
          actions between unrelated topics or ideas.</b>
        </p>

      <section id="subsection-2" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          We’re Pretty Much All Doing It
        </h2>

        <p>
          It’s not just me. Increasingly, knowledge workers are realizing the
          pain of context switching and the toll it takes on their productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t just take my word for it. Here’s a piece by productivity app Asana about
          <a href="https://asana.com/resources/context-switching" target="_blank" rel="external">the dangers of context switching</a>.
          From their article, 56% of employees feel pressure to check notifications immediately, and use up to 9 different apps each day. That’s so many apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally,
          <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~gmark/chi08-mark.pdf" target="_blank" rel="external">a study from the University of California, Irvine </a>
          shows that after 20 minutes of interruption, stress and frustration skyrocket.
        </p>
        <p>
          These metrics paint a bleak picture of how easy it is to be
          interrupted and, ultimately, be forced to switch contexts. Asana
          recommends some simple ways to try to mitigate interruption, including
          putting on Do Not Disturb and trying not to get derailed by
          notifications as much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those methods help, but they don’t address the full picture. The
          reality of context switching goes much deeper than just avoiding pesky
          notifications and using a
          <a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique" target="_blank" rel="external">pomodoro timer</a>,
          although both are solid ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Todoist, an aptly-named todo list app,
          <a href="https://todoist.com/inspiration/context-switching" target="_blank" rel="external">feels similarly about context switching</a>.
          They wrote an incredibly in-depth article that’s a great read if
          you’re looking to really, thoroughly understand a lot of the
          complicated parts of context switching.
        </p>
        <p>
          The long and the short of it is that context switching affects
          everything. It hurts your efficiency because you can’t batch your
          work as well. It hurts your effectiveness because you get distracted
          and have a hard time achieving flow. It hurts your mental health,
          which hurts literally everything else.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="subsection-3" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          You Can’t Avoid Context Switching
        </h2>

        <p>
          In a perfect world, you would finish all your tasks in a specific
          context before moving on to anything else. You’d get plenty of time
          for deep work, achieve flow for any and all skill-based tasks, and
          your days would play out exactly as planned.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our current fast-paced world, and especially if you’re a business
          owner, this doesn’t tend to happen. Instead, we switch contexts back
          and forth, leading to mental fatigue and potentially burnout.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world doesn’t play by your rules, or keep us from getting distracted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes it’s an onslaught of notifications, while other times it’s
          factors entirely out of your control like construction outside the
          window or a coworker calling in sick causing you to be responsible for
          extra load.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because a lot of the triggers for context switching are built deeply
          into our lives–phones, email, apps, social obligations, and work
          expectations&mdash;it’s difficult to tune all that out and get to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, we have to get creative when managing context switching to
          avoid burnout. There are a lot of techniques and approaches, all
          depending on where you work and how you work best.
        </p>
        <p>
          To set the expectation: context switching isn’t going away. It’s too
          fundamental to how we work and communicate in the modern age. Instead,
          our best bet is to manage how much of it we allow into our lives and when.

          Keep Tasks Location-Specific
        </h2>

        <p>
          From my own experience, sometimes the solution is to just just, plain
          and simple, work somewhere else. Sometimes I need to get the
          administrative work done another time than when I’m managing the front
          of the store.
        </p>
        <p>
          When this is possible, it’s a great way to avoid context switching.
          This happens simply by planning your tasks around possible
          interventions and changing your location to avoid distractions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have kids at home and need to get work done, for example, try
          going into the office, to a coworking space, or a local coffee shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Changing your location can be a great way to manage contexts–keep what
          you do in each space limited to the purpose of that space. You can
          even do this with different rooms in your home.
        </p>
        <p>
          What ends up happening when you stick to this method is each different
          physical location in your life becomes its own context. The coffee
          shop is coding time. Your home office is for email and administrative
          tasks. Your time at work is for upkeep and management.
        </p>
        <p>
          You create new contexts, each a form of bucket for specific tasks,
          that helps you stay focused and minimizes distractions.

        <p>
          Routines work for a reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re context switching a lot, and notice you often jump between
          unrelated tasks that span many genres of work, you might need to plan
          your time better.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, when I know I need to get a lot of work done on our
          website, I intentionally focus 2-3 days of my schedule on digital
          content. During this time, I focus exclusively on our web presence:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Write context marketing and edit copywriting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Redesign parts of the website.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust SEO on pre-order items in our web store.
          </li>
          <li>
            Conduct user experience testing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While not all of those are directly parallel in skillset, they all
          relate to the same context: our web presence. Content marketing is
          more about writing and SEO. That blends into the SEO adjustments I
          make elsewhere on the site. While I’m poking around the site, I’ll
          adjust the design in places where I notice it’s rough.
        </p>
        <p>
          User experience testing feeds into all of those categories by giving
          me direct feedback to use when adjusting the site or writing new content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now imagine I also shoved social media, procedure writing, and staff
          evaluations into the mix. Those are wildly different!
        </p>
        <p>
          If I had to pull my nose out of the website to conduct a performance
          review, I’d feel scattered. I’d have spent the first half of the day
          thinking about analytics and marketing, and then have to shift fully
          into manager mode with a focus on goal-setting and interpersonal
          communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, I put managerial tasks and team projects on their own days.
          That way, when I get to work I know immediately it’s a day to flex my
          communication skills and to organize tasks to orient the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Find the places in your own life where you can put that idea to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t work on marketing on the same days you’re adding new features to
          your service or fixing bugs. Don’t plan meetings for the same days
          you’re trying to review todo lists and build a new schedule of priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          By clumping related tasks together, you’ll avoid context switching
          even though you’ll still be doing all the same tasks, from all the
          different contexts, over the course of your work week.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Worth noting, not everyone works the same way. I highly recommend
          at least trying my suggestion to batch work, but it is possible you
          genuinely enjoy interweaving your work and switching between
          different tasks. If that’s true, then great!</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>More than anything, managing context switching is about finding the
          process that works for you and limits your personal stress and burnout.</i>

          Delegate to Avoid Switching Focus
        </h2>

        <p>
          Trimming down your tasks is a great way to become more efficient and
          organized overall. If you have way too much on your plate, you’ll end
          up context switching no matter what else you try.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why it’s worthwhile to examine your workflow, your tasks, and
          your responsibilities for a given day, week, or even longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, I feel so strongly about time and task management that I wrote
          <a href="navigating-time-as-a-business-owner.html">an entire article on managing your time better</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oftentimes, you’ll learn that there are huge chunks of work that are
          inefficient at best, or an absolute nightmare at worst. Sometimes it’s
          because you find yourself spending most of your time on a single task
          each day. Worse is when you don’t need to do that task yourself but
          have been anyway, causing it to eat away at your productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you evaluate where you spend your time and energy, it becomes
          clear what’s getting in the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, when I dove into my work days, I discovered that the biggest
          source of context switching ended up being the simple fact I was
          working behind the counter. This gave employees and customers
          immediate access to me, and often interrupted me during times of focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          To fix this, I started working from home more, and rearranged shifts
          so that I have more help during the day and am thus more able to step
          away for focused work.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is where delegation comes into play.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a team, then you’re likely already used to giving tasks to
          others. This is no different. Find the parts of your work that cause
          the most distraction and also generate the least value. Remove those
          from your own plate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you work by yourself, find tools and services that automate away
          inconveniences you face in your daily life or work routine. For
          instance, use AI to help you brainstorm sales copy you’re not
          motivated to write so you can minimize time spent doing it. Or, use a
          ticket tracking service for bug reports and issues with your software.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you find there’s an entire subset of work you’re doing (say, HR)
          that you have capital enough to hire someone to do instead, it’s often
          worth the tradeoff. Do your financial due diligence, but keep in mind
          that there are benefits to offloading entire sections of work besides
          just monetary ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your peace of mind will let you run a better company, make smarter
          decisions, and avoid burnout.

          Keep Yourself Accountable
        </h2>

        <p>
          It’s so easy to get distracted, especially when you work on a computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a million apps that want your attention. Emails. Messages
          from coworkers and employees. Cold calls. Meetings. The list could go
          on forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Part of managing context switching is to be accountable for your own
          decisions and the distractions you put in your path.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re managing a team, distractions are an inevitable part of your
          job. Learn to accept them and find ways to weave your other tasks into
          your day. After all, being a resource for your team and helping make
          decisions is most of what you should be doing, anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, if you’re an individual contributor or, especially,
          a business owner, you have to be willing to ruthlessly clear away
          distractions sometimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe that means putting your phone on silent. Maybe it means working
          from a place where nobody can physically reach you. If you need to
          download apps that lock down other apps, do it. If you need to put your
          phone in a box at the other end of your house, that’s fair play too.
        </p>
        <p>
          At a certain point, you just can’t let things intervene. It’s hard,
          and the opposite way of how a lot of our notification and ad-driven
          reality want us to live.
        </p>
        <p>
          But detoxing from notifications and being willing to look at something
          and acknowledge it can wait is essential. Even better if you can avoid
          looking at it in the first place until you’re ready to address it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Build the discipline to restrict yourself and your context.

          Final Words Against Context Switching
        </h2>

        <p>
          Really and truly you should be doing everything you can to minimize
          context switching. It’s going to burn you out. It’s burnt me out before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you just can’t avoid it. Urgent matters come up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Go attend your kid’s concert recital, or take them to a birthday
          party. Go out with your friends. Interrupt your work day to get lunch
          with an old colleague. In fact, it’s so important you let yourself be
          carried away by unexpected things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just, whenever possible, have ways to address it. Get off work early
          on the days you have long evening plans. Schedule other meetings and
          social tasks around your lunch outing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Context switching should be treated like an angry boss. It should be
          every bit as frustrating as the worst parts of your worst jobs. In
          fact, a lot of bad managers force us to switch contexts often, and
          that ends up being part of why we resent them so much.
        </p>
        <p>
          We won’t fully escape context switching, and that’s okay. Our brains
          can handle it. Our phones can handle it. We have apps to mitigate it.
        </p>
        <p>
          By doing everything we can to minimize it, and by ensuring we give
          ourselves large periods of time whenever possible to focus, we can
          maintain our productivity and continue to put out great work and run
          great companies.
        </p>

          <li>If you’re a developer or you manage developers, I highly recommend
          also reading this article on
          <a href="https://www.software.com/devops-guides/context-switching" target="_blank" rel="external">mitigating context switching for devs</a>.
          A lot of my advice still applies, but they get really specific about
          managing context switching in exactly and exclusively a software environment.</li>
