      <section itemprop="abstract">
        <p>
          Last month I was on 7 airplanes, in 4 countries, and at 2 work
          conferences. Most of that happened in the span of 12 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though I'm full of stories and excitement&mdash;not to mention
          exhausted&mdash;I want to focus on one thing in particular: my
          experience at GAMA Expo this year.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the third time I've attended Expo. The store has been a
          member of the organization for over a decade, and my business
          partners have attended about 10 times each. For them, it's a tried
          and true tradition, while I've been working to find my place in
          the commotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expo this year is the first time I’ve truly, deeply felt like I
          belong. Attending Expo was an opportunity to recharge, learn from
          amazing people, and see friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even without friends to visit and people to travel with, GAMA Expo
          has always been an awesome and worthwhile experience. If you're in
          the game industry and haven't joined, you should try it, and if you
          haven't attended Expo, I strongly recommend you do.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other conventions throughout the year, other gaming
          gatherings, and many of them are fun. Yet, Expo holds a special
          place in the industry: it's not consumer-facing at all. There are no
          customers around&mdash;it's a completely professional-facing conference.
          It's also the best time for people from all tiers of the industry
          to come together, break bread, share stories, and connect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is that so important?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, fair enough. Let's talk about GAMA Expo 2025.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="subsection-1" itemprop="articleBody">
        <h2 class="blog-subtitle js-heading">
          A Gathering of Friends
        </h2>

        <p>
          There isn't anything like being at GAMA Expo&mdash;where 3,400 retailers,
          publishers, creators, and everyone in between band together to take
          over the convention center and surrounding area of
          Louisville, Kentucky.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's the only time I get to see many of my all-time favorite people.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s how I recharge to face the upcoming year of work, and a great
          reward after spending Q1 buried in paperwork. It’s how I stay
          motivated and inspired to work hard on
          <a href="https://totalescapegames.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Total Escape Games </a>
          and keep optimistic in the face of new challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I left from Expo this year, I was so bummed. Even though I was heading
          abroad for a mix of business and pleasure, I missed everyone the
          second I said goodbye. I would’ve gladly traded my second trip to
          have more time at Expo. We had to leave early to attend the
          <a href="https://www.festivaldesjeux-cannes.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="external">Festival International Des Jeux </a>
          in Cannes, France, and next year I’m committed to staying the whole
          time at Expo, instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is what makes the tabletop gaming industry special. This is what
          I mean when I speak about community and togetherness. The connection
          I feel within our industry is unmatched&mdash;never have I seen so many
          people open to collaborating, and never have I received so much good
          advice in such a short period as at Expo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seminars are regularly packed as passionate professionals from
          throughout the world congregate to listen to our peers share advice.
          Game nights are alive with people from all tiers of the industry as
          we try new games to bring in&mdash;and slip in some casual games with
          friends to share in our industry-wide love of games.
        </p>

        <p id="learned-at-gama">
          Throughout GAMA Expo, I got to:
        </p>
        <ul aria-describedby="learned-at-gama">
          <li>
            Learn about copyright & trademark law
          </li>
          <li>
            Explore negotiating tactics and practice them with my peers
          </li>
          <li>
            See new and creative ways to market and brand the store
          </li>
          <li>
            Better understand inventory management, especially how it relates
            to eCommerce and managing multiple shopping channels
          </li>
          <li>
            Hear dozens of publishers explain their games and creative process
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The entire week is full of opportunity, learning, and new ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everywhere you go, people are talking in groups in hallways and at
          restaurants. People I’ve met once or twice smile and wave at me when
          I walk by or, if we both have time, stop and chat for a few minutes
          to catch up since last year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every year Expo reminds me there’s nothing I’d rather be than a
          part of the tabletop gaming industry.

          A Growing Industry
        </h2>

        <p>
          GAMA Expo hit a new milestone this year&mdash;3,400 attendees
          representing every tier of the industry, including nearly 700
          retail stores. This marks the second time in the last decade we've
          outgrown our venue, and in the coming years we'll see GAMA Expo
          move to accommodate this growth to better serve the members
          of the organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's incredible. I can feel the difference from my first attendance
          in 2022 even just in what it’s like to walk around and attend
          presentations. The air inside the conference is electric.
        </p>
        <p>
          The industry's reach is growing, we're achieving better diversity, and
          the professionalism is improving. This year’s seminars were by far
          the most interesting, diverse, and insightful I’ve seen thus far.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been in the industry for 8 years and I've never been more
          proud of my peers or my involvement with GAMA. We’ve come so far
          since the pandemic, let alone since I was a kid playing
          board games at home. Reached new audiences. Had breakaway hits
          that took over the mainstream
          (D&D, Wingspan, the Pokemon card game, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
          What could be considered a relatively new industry, a niche industry,
          has been growing explosively in recent years. There are a variety of
          factors that affect this&mdash;the pandemic, consumer interest in games,
          or a need for distraction that specifically isn’t on a phone.
          But, to me, it's because of the people at least as much as any
          other reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          The leaders of the industry care so deeply. They listen. The GAMA
          organization listens. We all want the industry to grow and prosper,
          not just for ourselves but for all of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've never seen people be more receptive to feedback at
          whatever scale. I've never seen companies with over $1B in annual
          revenue taking feedback from outside professionals like this, even
          from new retailers who have yet to hit six figures in revenue.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we were in Reno and had totally outgrown the convention center,
          GAMA got to work moving the convention to a bigger location.
        </p>
        <p>
          When retailers complained about the contents of the complimentary
          GAMA gift box (a box full of games as a thank you for attending),
          GAMA worked with publishers to get more in-demand games included.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the lunch vouchers turned lunch into a labyrinth of enormous
          lines and traffic jams in the convention center just to reach maybe
          the worst tacos on the planet, GAMA took note and changed the food
          plans for the following year.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the women and non-binary industry breakfast got scheduled on
          top of the Committee Open House, the president of GAMA found out and
          immediately got to work to make sure it didn’t happen again next year.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the board meeting that took place at Expo, there were questions
          about the Site Selection Committee and how they’ve been working to
          decide the next location for Expo. The questions were answered by
          members of the committee, in great detail, and even led to my
          <a href="https://www.johnmstephens.com/the-site-selection-committee/" target="_blank" rel="external">business partner creating a blog post</a>,
          in excruciating detail, about the criteria all sites had to pass.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a welcomeness to the industry that's hard to describe, and
          at the same time it feels like everyone’s eyes are on the future.
          There’s a lot of work getting done.

          Memories for a Lifetime
        </h2>

        <p>
          No matter what happens, no matter where I end up, I'll always
          remember my time attending GAMA Expo. The connections I've made
          there, and the friends I have from it, have genuinely changed my
          life. My time in the industry is punctuated by these
          memories&mdash;some of the brightest and most heartwarming
          moments I've ever had.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expo is where I was nearly brought to tears by an industry leader,
          a retailer I know and love, after she opened up about imposter
          syndrome and I felt myself resonate with her experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s also where I regularly stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning
          talking with peers, learning about their stores and their lives,
          joking around, and deepening our friendships.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s where I was told to believe in myself, where my opinions on
          business operations were not only respected but encouraged, and
          where I learned incredible lessons which help me
          better navigate Total Escape Games through any number of hardships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though Expo was just a few weeks ago, I already miss it. As I
          return to day-to-day life, to my work routines and big upcoming
          projects, I try to channel the energy I received from GAMA Expo
          and from my peers.
        </p>
        <p>
          That way,  when we all reunite next year, I can share the projects
          we’ve completed in the meantime, laugh and talk about life and
          business and strategy and life and everything in between, and
          it’ll feel like a family reunion.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's not something you can buy. That's not something any
          convention, or any industry, can promise just for the sake of it.
          But GAMA Expo has given me that sense of belonging in a way that
          defies words. It snuck up on me slowly and then all at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not here to evangelize the show or the organization.
          <a href="https://www.gama.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">GAMA has its own website </a>
          and can do that itself. Hell, we all know there are flaws in any
          organization and any event. Life is about progress, a sustainable
          improvement year after year that only upon looking back reveals the
          incredible heights to which we've climbed.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's what I want to say about GAMA. We're climbing right now–you,
          me, the whole industry. One day, when we look back, I can only
          imagine how proud we’ll be to reflect on the journey.

          <h3>Togetherness in Other Industries</h3>

          <p>
            If you’re not a part of the gaming industry, there’s still a
            takeaway here. Join a trade group, or a local networking
            opportunity, or even a chamber of commerce. Get involved with your
            industry and your peers. It’s amazing what a little bit of
            mentorship and friendly competition can do for both your
            motivation and achievement.
